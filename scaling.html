<p>Wayland is the next-generation display server for Unix-like systems, designed
and built by the alumni of the venerable Xorg server, and is the best way to get
your application windows onto your user's screens. Readers who have worked with
X11 in the past will be pleasantly surprised by Wayland's improvements, and
those who are new to graphics on Unix will find it a flexible and powerful
system for building graphical applications and desktops.</p>
<p>This book will help you establish a firm understanding of the concepts, design,
and implementation of Wayland, and equip you with the tools to build your own
Wayland client and server applications. Over the course of your reading, we'll
build a mental model of Wayland and establish the rationale that went into its
design. Within these pages you should find many &quot;aha!&quot; moments as the intuitive
design choices of Wayland become clear, which should help to keep the pages
turning. Welcome to the future of open source graphics!</p>
<p><strong>Notice</strong>: this is a <em>draft</em>. Chapters 1-10 are more or less complete, but may
be updated later. Chapters 11 forward in large part remain to be written.</p>
<p><strong>TODO</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Expand on resource lifetimes and avoiding race conditions in chapter 2.4</li>
<li>Move linux-dmabuf details to the appendix, add note about wl_drm &amp; mesa</li>
<li>Rewrite the introduction text</li>
<li>Add example code for interactive move, to demonstrate the use of serials</li>
<li>Use — instead of - where appropriate</li>
<li>Prepare PDFs and EPUBs</li>
</ul>

  In the words of Preston Carpenter, a close collaborator of Drew's:
</small>
<p>Drew DeVault got his start in the Wayland world by building sway, a clone of the
popular tiling window manager i3. It is now the most popular tiling Wayland
compositor by any measure: users, commit count, and influence. Following its
success, Drew gave back to the Wayland community by starting wlroots:
unopinionated, composable modules for building a Wayland compositor. Today it is
the foundation for dozens of independent compositors, and Drew is one of the
foremost experts in Wayland.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#high-level-design" id="high-level-design">High-level design</a></h1>
<p>Your computer has <em>input</em> and <em>output</em> devices, which respectively are
responsible for receiving information from you and displaying information to
you. These input devices take the form of, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keyboards</li>
<li>Mice</li>
<li>Touchpads</li>
<li>Touch screens</li>
<li>Drawing tablets</li>
</ul>
<p>Your output devices generally take the form of displays, on your desk or your
laptop or mobile device. These resources are shared between all of your
applications, and the role of the <strong>Wayland compositor</strong> is to dispatch input
events to the appropriate <strong>Wayland client</strong> and to display their windows in
their appropriate place on your outputs. The process of bringing together all of
your application windows for display on an output is called <em>compositing</em> - and
thus we call the software which does this the <em>compositor</em>.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#in-practice" id="in-practice">In practice</a></h2>
<p>There are many distinct software components in desktop ecosystem. There are
tools like mesa for rendering (and each of its drivers), the Linux KMS/DRM
subsystem, buffer allocation with GBM, the userspace libdrm library, libinput
and evdev, and much more still. Don't worry - expertise with most of these
systems is not required for understanding Wayland, and in any case are largely
beyond the scope of this book. In fact, the Wayland protocol is quite
conservative and abstract, and a Wayland-based desktop could easily be built &amp;
run most applications without implicating any of this software. That being said,
a surface-level understanding of what these pieces are and how they work is
useful. Let's start from the bottom and work our way up.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#the-hardware" id="the-hardware">The hardware</a></h2>
<p>A typical computer is equipped with a few important pieces of hardware. Outside
of the box, we have your displays, keyboard, mouse, perhaps some speakers and a
cute USB cup warmer. There are several components <em>inside</em> the box for
interfacing with these devices. Your keyboard and mouse, for example, are
probably plugged into USB ports, for which your system has a dedicated USB
controller. Your displays are plugged into your GPU.</p>
<p>These systems have their own jobs and state. For example, your GPU has state
in the form of memory for storing pixel buffers in, and jobs like <em>scanning
out</em> these buffers to your displays. Your GPU also provides a processor which is
specially tuned to be good at highly parallel jobs (such as calculating the
right color for each of the 2,073,600 pixels on a 1080p display), and bad at
everything else. The USB controller has the unenviable job of implementing the
legendarily dry USB specification for receiving input events from your keyboard,
or instructing your coaster to assume a temperature carefully selected to at
once avoid lawsuits and frustrate you with cold coffee.</p>
<p>At this level, your hardware has little concept of what applications are running
on your system. The hardware provides an interface with which it can be
commanded to perform work, and does what it's told - regardless of who tells it
so. For this reason, only one component is allowed to talk to it...</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#the-kernel" id="the-kernel">The kernel</a></h2>
<p>This responsibility falls onto the kernel. The kernel is a complex beast, so
we'll focus on only the parts which are relevant to Wayland. Linux's job is to
provide an abstraction over your hardware, so that they can be safely accessed
by <em>userspace</em> - where our Wayland compositors run. For graphics, this is called
<strong>DRM</strong>, or <em>direct rendering manager</em>, for efficiently tasking the GPU with
work from userspace. An important subsystem of DRM is <strong>KMS</strong>, or <em>kernel mode
setting</em>, for enumerating your displays and setting properties such as their
selected resolution (also known as their &quot;mode&quot;). Input devices are abstracted
through an interface called <strong>evdev</strong>.</p>
<p>Most kernel interfaces are made available to userspace by way of special files
in <code>/dev</code>. In the case of DRM, these files are in <code>/dev/dri/</code>, usually in the
form of a primary node (e.g. <code>card0</code>) for privileged operations like
modesetting, and a render node (e.g. <code>renderD128</code>), for unprivileged operations
like rendering or video decoding. For evdev, the &quot;device nodes&quot; are
<code>/dev/input/event*</code>.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#userspace" id="userspace">Userspace</a></h2>
<p>Now, we enter userspace. Here, applications are isolated from the hardware and
must work via the device nodes provided by the kernel.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#libdrm" id="libdrm">libdrm</a></h3>
<p>Most Linux interfaces have a userspace counterpart which provides a
pleasant(ish) C API for working with these device nodes. One such library is
libdrm, which is the userspace portion of the DRM subsystem. libdrm is used by
Wayland compositors to do modesetting and other DRM operations, but is generally
not used by Wayland clients directly.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#mesa" id="mesa">Mesa</a></h3>
<p>Mesa is one of the most important parts of the Linux graphics stack. It
provides, among other things, vendor-optimized implementations of OpenGL (and
Vulkan) for Linux and the <strong>GBM</strong> (Generic Buffer Management) library - an
abstraction on top of libdrm for allocating buffers on the GPU. Most Wayland
compositors will use both GBM and OpenGL via Mesa, and most Wayland clients will
use at least its OpenGL or Vulkan implementations.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#libinput" id="libinput">libinput</a></h3>
<p>Like libdrm abstracts the DRM subsystem, libinput provides the userspace end of
evdev. It's responsible for receiving input events from the kernel from your
various input devices, decoding them into a usable form, and passing them on to
the Wayland compositor. The Wayland compositor requires special permissions to
use the evdev files, forcing Wayland clients to go through the compositor to
receive input events - which, for example, prevents keylogging.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#eudev" id="eudev">(e)udev</a></h3>
<p>Dealing with the appearance of new devices from the kernel, configuring
permissions for the resulting device nodes in <code>/dev</code>, and sending word of these
changes to applications running on your system, is a responsibility that falls
onto userspace. Most systems use udev (or eudev, a fork) for this purpose. Your
Wayland compositor uses udev to enumerate input devices and GPUs, and to receive
notifications when new ones appear or old ones are unplugged.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#xkbcommon" id="xkbcommon">xkbcommon</a></h3>
<p>XKB, short for X keyboard, is the original keyboard handling subsystem of the
Xorg server. Several years ago, it was extracted from the Xorg tree and made
into an independent library for keyboard handling, and it no longer has any
practical relationship with X. Libinput (along with the Wayland compositor)
delivers keyboard events in the form of scancodes, whose precise meaning varies
from keyboard to keyboard. It's the responsibility of xkbcommon to translate
these scan codes into meaningful and generic key &quot;symbols&quot; - for example,
converting <code>65</code> to <code>XKB_KEY_Space</code>. It also contains a state machine which knows
that pressing &quot;1&quot; while shift is held emits &quot;!&quot;.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#pixman" id="pixman">pixman</a></h3>
<p>A simple library used by clients and compositors alike for efficiently
manipulating pixel buffers, doing math with intersecting rectangles, and
performing other similar <strong>pix</strong>el <strong>man</strong>ipulation tasks.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#libwayland" id="libwayland">libwayland</a></h3>
<p>libwayland the most commonly used implementation of the Wayland protocol,
is written in C, and handles much of the low-level wire protocol. It also
provides a tool which generates high-level code from Wayland protocol
definitions (which are XML files). We will be discussing libwayland in detail in
chapter 1.3, and throughout this book.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#and-all-the-rest" id="and-all-the-rest">...and all the rest.</a></h3>
<p>Each of the pieces mentioned so far are consistently found throughout the Linux
desktop ecosystem. Beyond this, more components exist. Many graphical
applications don't know about Wayland at all, choosing instead to allow
libraries like GTK+, Qt, SDL, and GLFW - among many others - to deal with it.
Many compositors choose software like wlroots to abstract more of their
responsibilities, while others implement everything in-house.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#goals--target-audience" id="goals--target-audience">Goals &amp; target audience</a></h1>
<p>Our goal is for you to come away from this book with an understanding of the
Wayland protocol and its high-level usage. You should have a solid understanding
of everything in the core Wayland protocol, as well as the knowledge necessary
to evaluate and implement the various protocol extensions necessary for its
productive use. Primarily, this book uses the concerns of a Wayland client to
frame its presentation of Wayland. However, it should provide some utility for
those working on Wayland compositors as well.</p>
<p>The free desktop ecosystem is complex and built from many discrete parts. We are
going to discuss these pieces very little - you won't find information here
about leveraging libdrm in your Wayland compositor, or using libinput to process
evdev events. Thus, this book is not a comprehensive guide for building Wayland
compositors. We're also not going to talk about drawing technologies which are
useful for Wayland clients, such as Cairo, Pango, GTK+, and so on, and thus
neither is this a robust guide for the practical Wayland client implementation.
Instead, we focus only on the particulars of Wayland.</p>
<p>This book only covers the protocol and libwayland. If you are writing a client
and are already familiar with your favorite user interface rendering library,
bring your own pixels and we'll help you display them on Wayland. If you already
have an understanding of the technologies required to operate displays and input
devices for your compositor, this book will help you learn how to talk to
clients.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#whats-in-the-wayland-package" id="whats-in-the-wayland-package">What's in the Wayland package</a></h1>
<p>When you install &quot;wayland&quot; in your Linux distribution, you'll most likely end up
with the freedesktop.org distribution of libwayland-client, libwayland-server,
wayland-scanner, and wayland.xml. Respectively, these will probably be in
/usr/lib &amp; /usr/include, /usr/bin, and /usr/share/wayland/. This package
represents the most popular <em>implementation</em> of the Wayland protocol, but it is
not the only one. Chapter 3 covers this implementation of Wayland in detail; the
rest of the book is equally applicable to any implementation.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#waylandxml" id="waylandxml">wayland.xml</a></h2>
<p>Wayland protocols are defined by XML files. If you locate and open &quot;wayland.xml&quot;
in your favorite text editor, you will find the XML specification for the &quot;core&quot;
Wayland protocol. This is a high-level protocol - built on top of the wire
protocol that we'll discuss in the next chapter. Most of this book is devoted to
explaining this file.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#wayland-scanner" id="wayland-scanner">wayland-scanner</a></h2>
<p>The &quot;wayland-scanner&quot; tool is used to process these XML files and generate code
from them. The most common implementation is the one you're examining now, and
it can be used to generate C headers &amp; glue code from XML files like
wayland.xml. Other scanners exist for other programming languages, notably
wayland-rs (Rust), waymonad-scanner (Haskell), and more.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#libwayland-1" id="libwayland-1">libwayland</a></h2>
<p>The two libraries, libwayland-client and libwayland-server, include an
implementation of the wire protocol for each end of the connection. Some common
utilities are offered for working with Wayland data structures, a simple event
loop, and so on. Additionally, these libraries contain a pre-compiled copy of
the core Wayland protocol as generated by <code>wayland-scanner</code>.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#protocol-design" id="protocol-design">Protocol design</a></h1>
<p>The Wayland protocol is built from several layers of abstraction. It starts with
a basic wire protocol format, which is a stream of messages decodable with
interfaces agreed upon in advance. Then we have higher level procedures for
enumerating interfaces, creating resources which conform to these interfaces,
and exchanging messages about them - the Wayland protocol and its extensions. On
top of this we have some broader patterns which are frequently used in Wayland
protocol design. We'll cover all of these in this chapter.</p>
<p>Let's work our way from the bottom-up.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#wire-protocol-basics" id="wire-protocol-basics">Wire protocol basics</a></h1>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: If you're just going to use libwayland, this chapter is optional -
feel free to skip to chapter 2.2.</p>
<hr />
<p>The wire protocol is a stream of 32-bit values, encoded with the host's byte
order (e.g. little-endian on x86 family CPUs). These values represent the
following primitive types:</p>
<p><strong>int, uint</strong>: 32-bit signed or unsigned integer.</p>
<p><strong>fixed</strong>: 24.8 bit signed fixed-point numbers.</p>
<p><strong>object</strong>: 32-bit object ID.</p>
<p><strong>new_id</strong>: 32-bit object ID which allocates that object when received.</p>
<p>In addition to these primitives, the following other types are used:</p>
<p><strong>string</strong>: A string, prefixed with a 32-bit integer specifying its length (in
bytes), followed by the string contents and a NUL terminator, padded to 32
bits with undefined data. The encoding is not specified, but in practice UTF-8
is used.</p>
<p><strong>array</strong>: A blob of arbitrary data, prefixed with a 32-bit integer specifying
its length (in bytes), then the verbatim contents of the array, padded to 32
bits with undefined data.</p>
<p><strong>fd</strong>: 0-bit value on the primary transport, but transfers a file descriptor to
the other end using the ancillary data in the Unix domain socket message
(msg_control).</p>
<p><strong>enum</strong>: A single value (or bitmap) from an enumeration of known constants,
encoded into a 32-bit integer.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#messages" id="messages">Messages</a></h2>
<p>The wire protocol is a stream of messages built with these primitives. Every
message is an event (in the case of server to client messages) or request
(client to server) which acts upon an <em>object</em>.</p>
<p>The message header is two words. The first word is the affected object ID. The
second is two 16-bit values; the upper 16 bits are the size of the message
(including the header itself) and the lower 16 bits are the event or request
opcode. The message arguments follow, based on a message signature agreed upon
in advance by both parties. The recipient looks up the object ID's interface and
the event or request defined by its opcode to determine the signature and nature
of the message.</p>
<p>To understand a message, the client and server have to establish the objects in
the first place. Object ID 1 is pre-allocated as the Wayland display singleton,
and can be used to bootstrap other objects. We'll discuss this in chapter 4. The
next chapter goes over what an interface is, and how requests and events work,
assuming you've already negotiated an object ID. Speaking of which...</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#object-ids" id="object-ids">Object IDs</a></h2>
<p>When a message comes in with a <code>new_id</code> argument, the sender allocates an
object ID for it (the interface used for this object is established through
additional arguments, or agreed upon in advance for that request/event). This
object ID can be used in future messages, either as the first word of the
header, or as an <code>object_id</code> argument. The client allocates IDs in the range of
<code>[1, 0xFEFFFFFF]</code>, and the server allocates IDs in the range of <code>[0xFF000000, 0xFFFFFFFF]</code>. IDs begin at the lower end of this bound and increment with each
new object allocation.</p>
<p>An object ID of 0 represents a null object; that is, a non-existent object or
the explicit lack of an object.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#transports" id="transports">Transports</a></h2>
<p>To date all known Wayland implementations work over a Unix domain socket. This
is used for one reason in particular: file descriptor messages. Unix sockets are
the most practical transport capable of transferring file descriptors between
processes, and this is necessary for large data transfers (keymaps, pixel
buffers, and clipboard contents being the main use-cases). In theory, a
different transport (e.g. TCP) is possible, but someone would have to figure out
an alternative way of transferring bulk data.</p>
<p>To find the Unix socket to connect to, most implementations just do what
libwayland does:</p>
<ol>
<li>If <code>WAYLAND_SOCKET</code> is set, interpret it as a file descriptor number on which
the connection is already established, assuming that the parent process
configured the connection for us.</li>
<li>If <code>WAYLAND_DISPLAY</code> is set, concat with <code>XDG_RUNTIME_DIR</code> to form the path
to the Unix socket.</li>
<li>Assume the socket name is <code>wayland-0</code> and concat with <code>XDG_RUNTIME_DIR</code> to
form the path to the Unix socket.</li>
<li>Give up.</li>
</ol>
<h1><a class="header" href="#interfaces-requests-and-events" id="interfaces-requests-and-events">Interfaces, requests, and events</a></h1>
<p>The Wayland protocol works by issuing <em>requests</em> and <em>events</em> that act on
<em>objects</em>. Each object has an <em>interface</em> which defines what requests and events
are possible, and the <em>signature</em> of each. Let's consider an example interface:
<code>wl_surface</code>.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#requests" id="requests">Requests</a></h2>
<p>A surface is a box of pixels that can be displayed on-screen. It's one of the
primitives we build things like application windows out of. One of its
<em>requests</em> is &quot;damage&quot;, which the client uses to indicate that some part of the
surface has changed and needs to be redrawn. Here's an annotated example of a
&quot;damage&quot; message on the wire (in hexadecimal):</p>
<pre><code>0000000A    Object ID (10)
00180002    Message length (24) and request opcode (2)
00000000    X coordinate (int): 0
00000000    Y coordinate (int): 0
00000100    Width        (int): 256
00000100    Height       (int): 256
</code></pre>
<p>This is a snippet of a session - the surface was allocated earlier and assigned
an ID of 10. When the server receives this message, it looks up the object with
ID 10 and finds that it's a <code>wl_surface</code> instance. Knowing this, it looks up the
signature for the request with opcode 2. It then knows to expect four integers
as the arguments, and it can decode the message and dispatch it for processing
internally.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#events" id="events">Events</a></h2>
<p>Requests are sent from the client to the server. The server can also send
messages back - events. One event that the server can send regarding a
<code>wl_surface</code> is &quot;enter&quot;, which it sends when that surface is being displayed on
a specific output (the client might respond to this, for example, by adjusting
its scale factor for a HiDPI display). Here's an example of such a message:</p>
<pre><code>0000000A    Object ID (10)
000B0000    Message length (12) and event opcode (0)
00000005    Output (object ID): 5
</code></pre>
<p>This message references another object, by its ID: the <code>wl_output</code> object which
the surface is being shown on. The client receives this and dances to a similar
tune as the server did. It looks up object 10, associates it with the
<code>wl_surface</code> interface, and looks up the signature of the event corresponding to
opcode 0. It decodes the rest of the message accordingly (looking up the
<code>wl_output</code> with ID 5 as well), then dispatches it for processing internally.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#interfaces" id="interfaces">Interfaces</a></h2>
<p>The interfaces which define the list of requests and events, the opcodes
associated with each, and the signatures with which you can decode the messages -
are agreed upon in advance. I'm sure you're dying to know how - simply turn the
page to end the suspense.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#the-high-level-protocol" id="the-high-level-protocol">The high-level protocol</a></h1>
<p>In chapter 1.3, I mentioned that <code>wayland.xml</code> is probably installed with the
Wayland package on your system. Find and pull up that file now in your favorite
text editor. It's through this file, and others like it, that we define the
interfaces supported by a Wayland client or server.</p>
<p>Each interface is defined in this file, along with its requests and events, and
their respective signatures. We use XML, everyone's favorite file format, for
this purpose. Let's look at the examples we discussed in the previous chapter
for <code>wl_surface</code>. Here's a sample:</p>
<pre><code class="language-xml">&lt;interface name=&quot;wl_surface&quot; version=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
  &lt;request name=&quot;damage&quot;&gt;
    &lt;arg name=&quot;x&quot; type=&quot;int&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;arg name=&quot;y&quot; type=&quot;int&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;arg name=&quot;width&quot; type=&quot;int&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;arg name=&quot;height&quot; type=&quot;int&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/request&gt;

  &lt;event name=&quot;enter&quot;&gt;
    &lt;arg name=&quot;output&quot; type=&quot;object&quot; interface=&quot;wl_output&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/event&gt;
&lt;/interface&gt;
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: I've trimmed this snippet for brevity, but if you have the
<code>wayland.xml</code> file in front of you, seek out this interface and examine it
yourself - included is additional documentation explaining the purpose and
precise semantics of each request and event.</p>
<p>When processing this XML file, we assign each request and event an opcode in the
order that they appear (both numbered from zero and incrementing independently).
Combined with the list of arguments, you can decode the request or event when it
comes in over the wire, and based on the documentation shipped in the XML file
you can decide how to program your software to behave accordingly.  This usually
comes in the form of code generation - we'll talk about how libwayland does this
in chapter 3.</p>
<p>Starting from chapter 4, most of the remainder of this book is devoted to
explaining this file, as well as some supplementary protocol extensions.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#protocol-design-patterns" id="protocol-design-patterns">Protocol design patterns</a></h1>
<p>There are some key concepts which have been applied in the design of most
Wayland protocols that we should briefly cover here. These patterns are found
throughout the high-level Wayland protocol and protocol extensions (well, in the
Wayland protocol, at least<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup>). If you find yourself writing your own
protocol extensions, you'd be wise to apply these patterns yourself.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#atomicity" id="atomicity">Atomicity</a></h2>
<p>The most important of the Wayland protocol design patterns is <em>atomicity</em>. A
stated goal of Wayland is &quot;every frame is perfect&quot;. To this end, most interfaces
allow you to update them transactionally, using several requests to build up a
new representation of its state, then committing them all at once. For example,
there are several properties that may be configured on a <code>wl_surface</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>An attached pixel buffer</li>
<li>A damaged area that needs to be redrawn</li>
<li>A region defined as opaque, for optimization purposes</li>
<li>A region where input events are acceptable</li>
<li>A transformation, like rotating 90 degrees</li>
<li>A buffer scale, used for HiDPI</li>
</ul>
<p>The interface includes separate requests for configuring each of these, but
these are applied to a <em>pending</em> state. Only when the <strong>commit</strong> request is sent
does the pending state get merged into the <em>current</em> state, allowing you to
atomically update all of these properties within a single frame. Combined with a
few other key design decisions, this allows Wayland compositors to render
everything perfectly in every frame - no tearing or partially updated windows,
just every pixel in its place and every place in its pixel.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#resource-lifetimes" id="resource-lifetimes">Resource lifetimes</a></h2>
<p>Another important design pattern is avoiding a situation where the server or
client is sending events or requests that pertain to an invalid object. For this
reason, interfaces which define resources that have finite lifetimes will often
include requests and events through which the client or server can state their
intention to no longer send requests or events for that object. Only once both
sides have agreed to this - asynchronously - do they destroy the resources they
allocated for that object.</p>
<p>Wayland is a fully asynchronous protocol. Messages are guaranteed to arrive in
the order they were sent, but only with respect to one sender. For example, the
server may have several input events queued up when the client decides to
destroy its keyboard device. The client must correctly deal with events for an
object it no longer needs until the server catches up. Likewise, had the client
queued up some requests for an object before destroying it, it would have had to
send these requests in the correct order so that the object is no longer used
after the client agreed it had been destroyed.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#versioning" id="versioning">Versioning</a></h2>
<p>There are two versioning models in use in Wayland protocols: unstable and
stable. Both models only allow for backwards-compatible changes, but when a
protocol transitions from unstable to stable, breaking changes are permitted.
This gives protocols an incubation period during which we can test them in
practice, then apply what we've learned to a protocol that should stand the test
of time in one big breaking change<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#2">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>To make a backwards-compatible change, you may only add new events or requests
to the end of an interface, or new members to the end of an enum. Additionally,
each implementation must limit itself to using only the messages supported by
the other end of the connection. We'll discuss in chapter 5 how we establish
which versions of each interface are in use by each party.</p>
<div class="footnote-definition" id="1"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">1</sup>
<p>Except for that one interface. Look, at least we tried, right?</p>
</div>
<div class="footnote-definition" id="2"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">2</sup>
<p>Note that many useful protocols are still unstable at the time of writing. They may be a little kludgy, but they still see widespread use, which is why backwards compatibility is important. When promoting a protocol from unstable to stable, it's done in a way that allows software to support both the unstable and stable protocols simultaneously, allowing for a smoother transition.</p>
</div>
<h1><a class="header" href="#the-libwayland-implementation" id="the-libwayland-implementation">The libwayland implementation</a></h1>
<p>We spoke briefly about libwayland in chapter 1.3 - the most popular Wayland
implementation. Much of this book is applicable to any implementation, but we're
going to spend the next two chapters familiarizing you with this one.</p>
<p>The Wayland package includes pkg-config specs for wayland-client and
wayland-server - consult your build system's documentation for instructions on
linking with them. Naturally, most applications will only link to one or the
other. The library includes a few simple primitives (such as a linked list) and
a pre-compiled version of <code>wayland.xml</code> - the core Wayland protocol.</p>
<p>We'll start by introducing the primitives.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#wayland-util-primitives" id="wayland-util-primitives">wayland-util primitives</a></h1>
<p>Common to both the client and server libraries is <code>wayland-util.h</code>, which
defines a number of structs, utility functions, and macros that establish a
handful of primitives for use in Wayland applications. Among these are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Structures for marshalling &amp; unmarshalling Wayland protocol messages in
generated code</li>
<li>A linked list (<code>wl_list</code>) implementation</li>
<li>An array (<code>wl_array</code>) implementation (rigged up to the
corresponding Wayland primitive)</li>
<li>Utilities for conversion between Wayland scalars (such as fixed-point
numbers) and C types</li>
<li>Debug logging facilities to bubble up information from libwayland internals</li>
</ul>
<p>The header contains many comments which document itself. The documentation is
quite good - you should read through the header yourself. We'll go into detail
on how to apply these primitives in the next several pages.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#wayland-scanner-1" id="wayland-scanner-1">wayland-scanner</a></h1>
<p>The Wayland package comes with one binary: <code>wayland-scanner</code>. This tool is used
to generate C headers &amp; glue code from the Wayland protocol XML files discussed
in chapter 2.3. This tool is used in the &quot;wayland&quot; package's build process to
pre-generate headers &amp; glue code for the core protocol, <code>wayland.xml</code>. The
headers become <code>wayland-client-protocol.h</code> and <code>wayland-server-protocol.h</code> -
though you normally include <code>wayland-client.h</code> and <code>wayland-server.h</code> instead of
using these directly.</p>
<p>The usage of this tool is fairly simple (and summarized by <code>wayland-scanner -h</code>), but can be summed up as follows. To generate a client header:</p>
<pre><code>wayland-scanner client-header &lt; protocol.xml &gt; protocol.h
</code></pre>
<p>To generate a server header:</p>
<pre><code>wayland-scanner server-header &lt; protocol.xml &gt; protocol.h
</code></pre>
<p>And to generate the glue code:</p>
<pre><code>wayland-scanner private-code &lt; protocol.xml &gt; protocol.c
</code></pre>
<p>Different build systems will have different approaches to configuring custom
commands - consult your build system's docs. Generally speaking, you'll want to
run <code>wayland-scanner</code> at build time, then compile and link your application to
the glue code.</p>
<p>Go ahead and do this with any Wayland protocol now, if you have one handy
(<code>wayland.xml</code> is probably available in <code>/usr/share/wayland</code>, for example). Open
up the glue code &amp; header and consult it as you read the following chapters, to
understand how the primitives offered by libwayland are applied in practice in
the generated code.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#proxies--resources" id="proxies--resources">Proxies &amp; resources</a></h1>
<p>An <em>object</em> is an entity which known to both the client and server that has some
state, changes to which are negotiated over the wire. On the client side,
libwayland refers to these objects through the <code>wl_proxy</code> interface. These are a
concrete C-friendly &quot;proxy&quot; for the abstract object, and provides functions
which are indirectly used by the client to marshall requests into the wire
format. If you review the <code>wayland-client-core.h</code> file, you'll find a few
low-level functions for this purpose. Generally, you don't use these directly.</p>
<p>On the server, objects are abstracted through <code>wl_resource</code>, which is fairly
similar, but have an extra degree of complexity - the server has to track which
object belongs to which client. Each <code>wl_resource</code> is owned by a single client.
Aside from this, the interface is much the same, and provides low-level
abstraction for marshalling events to send to the associated client. You will
use <code>wl_resource</code> directly on a server more often than you'll use directly
interface with <code>wl_proxy</code> on a client. One example of such a use is to obtain a
reference to the <code>wl_client</code> which owns a resource that you're manipulating
out-of-context, or send a protocol error when the client attempts an invalid
operation.</p>
<p>Another level up is another set of higher-level interfaces, which most Wayland
client &amp; server code interacts with to accomplish a majority of their tasks.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#interfaces--listeners" id="interfaces--listeners">Interfaces &amp; listeners</a></h1>
<p>Finally, we reach the summit of libwayland's abstractions: interfaces and
listeners. The ideas discussed in previous chapters - <code>wl_proxy</code> and
<code>wl_resource</code>, and the primitives - are singular implementations which live in
libwayland, and they exist to provide support to this layer. When you run an XML
file through wayland-scanner, it generates <em>interfaces</em> and <em>listeners</em>, as well
as glue code between them and the low-level wire protocol interfaces, all
specific to each interface in the high-level protocols.</p>
<p>Recall that each actor on a Wayland connection can both receive and send
messages. A client is listening for events and sending requests, and a server
listens for requests and sends events. Each side listens for the messages of the
other using an aptly-named <code>wl_listener</code>. Here's an example of this interface:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">struct wl_surface_listener {
	/** surface enters an output */
	void (*enter)(void *data,
		      struct wl_surface *wl_surface,
		      struct wl_output *output);

	/** surface leaves an output */
	void (*leave)(void *data,
		      struct wl_surface *wl_surface,
		      struct wl_output *output);
};
</code></pre>
<p>This is a client-side listener for a <code>wl_surface</code>. The XML that wayland-scanner
uses to generate this is:</p>
<pre><code class="language-xml">&lt;interface name=&quot;wl_surface&quot; version=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
  &lt;event name=&quot;enter&quot;&gt;
    &lt;arg name=&quot;output&quot;
      type=&quot;object&quot;
      interface=&quot;wl_output&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;/event&gt;

  &lt;event name=&quot;leave&quot;&gt;
    &lt;arg name=&quot;output&quot;
      type=&quot;object&quot;
      interface=&quot;wl_output&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;/event&gt;
  &lt;!-- additional details omitted for brevity --&gt;
&lt;/interface&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>It should be fairly clear how these events become a listener interface. Each
function pointer takes some arbitrary user data, a reference to the resource
which the event pertains to, and the arguments to that event. We can bind a
listener to a <code>wl_surface</code> like so:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">static void wl_surface_enter(void *data,
        struct wl_surface *wl_surface, struct wl_output *output) {
    // ...
}

static void wl_surface_leave(void *data,
        struct wl_surface *wl_surface, struct wl_output *output) {
    // ...
}

static const struct wl_surface_listener surface_listener = {
    .enter = wl_surface_enter,
    .leave = wl_surface_leave,
};

// ...cotd...

struct wl_surface *surf;
wl_surface_add_listener(surf, &amp;surface_listener, NULL);
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>wl_surface</code> interface also defines some requests that the client can make
for that surface:</p>
<pre><code class="language-xml">&lt;interface name=&quot;wl_surface&quot; version=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
  &lt;request name=&quot;attach&quot;&gt;
    &lt;arg name=&quot;buffer&quot;
      type=&quot;object&quot;
      interface=&quot;wl_buffer&quot;
      allow-null=&quot;true&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;arg name=&quot;x&quot; type=&quot;int&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;arg name=&quot;y&quot; type=&quot;int&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;/request&gt;
  &lt;!-- additional details omitted for brevity --&gt;
&lt;/interface&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>wayland-scanner generates the following prototype, as well as glue code which
marshalls this message.</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">void wl_surface_attach(struct wl_surface *wl_surface,
    struct wl_buffer *buffer, int32_t x, int32_t y);
</code></pre>
<p>The server-side code for interfaces and listeners is identical, but reversed -
it generates listeners for requests and glue code for events. When libwayland
receives a message, it looks up the object ID, and its interface, then uses that
to decode the rest of the message. Then it looks for listeners on this object
and invokes your functions with the arguments to the message.</p>
<p>That's all there is to it! It took us a couple of layers of abstraction to get
here, but you should now understand how an event starts in your server code,
becomes a message on the wire, is understood by the client, and dispatched to
your client code. There remains one unanswered question, however. All of this
presupposes that you already have references to Wayland objects. How do you get
those?</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#the-wayland-display" id="the-wayland-display">The Wayland display</a></h1>
<p>Up to this point, we've left a crucial detail out of our explanation of how the
Wayland protocol manages joint ownership over objects between the client and
server: how those objects are created in the first place. The Wayland display,
or <code>wl_display</code>, implicitly exists on every Wayland connection. It has the
following interface:</p>
<pre><code class="language-xml">&lt;interface name=&quot;wl_display&quot; version=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
  &lt;request name=&quot;sync&quot;&gt;
    &lt;arg name=&quot;callback&quot; type=&quot;new_id&quot; interface=&quot;wl_callback&quot;
       summary=&quot;callback object for the sync request&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;/request&gt;

  &lt;request name=&quot;get_registry&quot;&gt;
    &lt;arg name=&quot;registry&quot; type=&quot;new_id&quot; interface=&quot;wl_registry&quot;
      summary=&quot;global registry object&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;/request&gt;

  &lt;event name=&quot;error&quot;&gt;
    &lt;arg name=&quot;object_id&quot; type=&quot;object&quot; summary=&quot;object where the error occurred&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;arg name=&quot;code&quot; type=&quot;uint&quot; summary=&quot;error code&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;arg name=&quot;message&quot; type=&quot;string&quot; summary=&quot;error description&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;/event&gt;

  &lt;enum name=&quot;error&quot;&gt;
    &lt;entry name=&quot;invalid_object&quot; value=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;entry name=&quot;invalid_method&quot; value=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;entry name=&quot;no_memory&quot; value=&quot;2&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;entry name=&quot;implementation&quot; value=&quot;3&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/enum&gt;

  &lt;event name=&quot;delete_id&quot;&gt;
    &lt;arg name=&quot;id&quot; type=&quot;uint&quot; summary=&quot;deleted object ID&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;/event&gt;
&lt;/interface&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The most interesting of these for the average Wayland user is <code>get_registry</code>,
which we'll talk about in detail in the following chapter. In short, the
registry is used to allocate other objects. The rest of the interface is used
for housekeeping on the connection, and are generally not important unless
you're writing your own libwayland replacement.</p>
<p>Instead, this chapter will focus on a number of functions that libwayland
associated with the <code>wl_display</code> object, for establishing and maintaining your
Wayland connection. These are used to manipulate libwayland's internal state,
rather than being directly related to wire protocol requests and events.</p>
<p>We'll start with the most important of these functions: establishing the
display. For clients, this will cover the actual process of connecting to the
server, and for servers, the process of configuring a display for clients to
connect to.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#creating-a-display" id="creating-a-display">Creating a display</a></h1>
<p>Fire up your text editor - it's time to write our first lines of code.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#for-wayland-clients" id="for-wayland-clients">For Wayland clients</a></h2>
<p>Connecting to a Wayland server and creating a <code>wl_display</code> to manage the
connection's state is quite easy:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;wayland-client.h&gt;

int
main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    struct wl_display *display = wl_display_connect(NULL);
    if (!display) {
        fprintf(stderr, &quot;Failed to connect to Wayland display.\n&quot;);
        return 1;
    }
    fprintf(stderr, &quot;Connection established!\n&quot;);

    wl_display_disconnect(display);
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Let's compile and run this program. Assuming you're using a Wayland compositor
as you read this, the result should look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ cc -o client -lwayland-client client.c
$ ./client
Connection established!
</code></pre>
<p><code>wl_display_connect</code> is the most common way for clients to establish a Wayland
connection. The signature is:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">struct wl_display *wl_display_connect(const char *name);
</code></pre>
<p>The &quot;name&quot; argument is the name of the Wayland display, which is typically
<code>&quot;wayland-0&quot;</code>. You can swap the <code>NULL</code> for this in our test client and try for
yourself - it's likely to work. This corresponds to the name of a Unix socket in
<code>$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR</code>. <code>NULL</code> is preferred, however, in which case libwayland will:</p>
<ol>
<li>If <code>$WAYLAND_DISPLAY</code> is set, attempt to connect to
<code>$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/$WAYLAND_DISPLAY</code></li>
<li>Attempt to connect to <code>$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/wayland-0</code></li>
<li>Fail :(</li>
</ol>
<p>This allows users to specify the Wayland display they want to run their clients
on by setting the <code>$WAYLAND_DISPLAY</code> to the desired display. If you have more
complex requirements, you can also establish the connection yourself and create
a Wayland display from a file descriptor:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">struct wl_display *wl_display_connect_to_fd(int fd);
</code></pre>
<p>You can also obtain the file descriptor that the <code>wl_display</code> is using via
<code>wl_display_get_fd</code>, regardless of how you created the display.</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">int wl_display_get_fd(struct wl_display *display);
</code></pre>
<h2><a class="header" href="#for-wayland-servers" id="for-wayland-servers">For Wayland servers</a></h2>
<p>The process is fairly simple for servers as well. The creation of the display
and binding to a socket are separate, to give you time to configure the display
before any clients are able to connect to it. Here's another minimal example
program:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;wayland-server.h&gt;

int
main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    struct wl_display *display = wl_display_create();
    if (!display) {
        fprintf(stderr, &quot;Unable to create Wayland display.\n&quot;);
        return 1;
    }

    const char *socket = wl_display_add_socket_auto(display);
    if (!socket) {
        fprintf(stderr, &quot;Unable to add socket to Wayland display.\n&quot;);
        return 1;
    }

    fprintf(stderr, &quot;Running Wayland display on %s\n&quot;, socket);
    wl_display_run(display);

    wl_display_destroy(display);
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Let's compile and run this, too:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ cc -o server -lwayland-server server.c
$ ./server &amp;
Running Wayland display on wayland-1
$ WAYLAND_DISPLAY=wayland-1 ./client
Connection established!
</code></pre>
<p>Using <code>wl_display_add_socket_auto</code> will allow libwayland to decide the name for
the display automatically, which defaults to <code>wayland-0</code>, or <code>wayland-$n</code>,
depending on if any other Wayland compositors have sockets in
<code>$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR</code>. However, as with the client, you have some other options for
configuring the display:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">int wl_display_add_socket(struct wl_display *display, const char *name);

int wl_display_add_socket_fd(struct wl_display *display, int sock_fd);
</code></pre>
<p>After adding the socket, calling <code>wl_display_run</code> will run libwayland's internal
event loop and block until <code>wl_display_terminate</code> is called. What's this event
loop? Turn the page and find out!</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#incorporating-an-event-loop" id="incorporating-an-event-loop">Incorporating an event loop</a></h1>
<p>libwayland provides its own event loop implementation for Wayland servers to
take advantage of, but the maintainers have acknowledged this as a design
overstep. For clients, there is no such equivalent. However, the Wayland server
event loop is useful enough, even if it's out-of-scope.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#wayland-server-event-loop" id="wayland-server-event-loop">Wayland server event loop</a></h2>
<p>Each <code>wl_display</code> created by libwayland-server has a corresponding
<code>wl_event_loop</code>, which you may obtain a reference to with
<code>wl_display_get_event_loop</code>. If you're writing a new Wayland compositor, you
will likely want to use this as your only event loop. You can add file
descriptors to it with <code>wl_event_loop_add_fd</code>, and timers with
<code>wl_event_loop_add_timer</code>. It also handles signals via
<code>wl_event_loop_add_signal</code>, which can be pretty convenient.</p>
<p>With the event loop configured to your liking to monitor all of the events your
compositor has to respond to, you can process events and dispatch Wayland
clients all at once by calling <code>wl_display_run</code>, which will process the event
loop and block until the display terminates (via <code>wl_display_terminate</code>). Most
Wayland compositors which were built from the ground-up with Wayland in mind (as
opposed to being ported from X11) use this approach.</p>
<p>However, it's also possible to take the wheel and incorporate the Wayland
display into your own event loop. <code>wl_display</code> uses the event loop internally
for processing clients, and you can choose to either monitor the Wayland event
loop on your own, dispatching it as necessary, or you can disregard it
entirely and manually process client updates. If you wish to allow the Wayland
event loop to look after itself and treat it as subservient to your own event
loop, you can use <code>wl_event_loop_get_fd</code> to obtain a <a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/poll.html">poll</a>-able file
descriptor, then call <code>wl_event_loop_dispatch</code> to process events when activity
occurs on that file descriptor. You will also need to call
<code>wl_display_flush_clients</code> when you have data which needs writing to clients.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#wayland-client-event-loop" id="wayland-client-event-loop">Wayland client event loop</a></h2>
<p>libwayland-client, on the other hand, does not have its own event loop. However,
since there is only generally one file descriptor, it's easier to manage
without. If Wayland events are the only sort which your program expects, then
this simple loop will suffice:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">while (wl_display_dispatch(display) != -1) {
    /* This space deliberately left blank */
}
</code></pre>
<p>However, if you have a more sophisticated application, you can build your own
event loop in any manner you please, and obtain the Wayland display's file
descriptor with <code>wl_display_get_fd</code>. Upon <code>POLLIN</code> events, call
<code>wl_display_dispatch</code> to process incoming events. To flush outgoing requests,
call <code>wl_display_flush</code>.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#almost-there" id="almost-there">Almost there!</a></h2>
<p>At this point you have all of the context you need to set up a Wayland
display and process events and requests. The only remaining step is to allocate
objects to chat about with the other side of your connection. For this, we use
the registry. At the end of the next chapter, we will have our first useful
Wayland client!</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#globals--the-registry" id="globals--the-registry">Globals &amp; the registry</a></h1>
<p>If you'll recall from chapter 2.1, each request and event is associated with an
object ID, but thus far we haven't discussed how objects are created. When we
receive a Wayland message, we must know what interface the object ID represents
to decode it. We must also somehow negotiate available objects, the creation of
new ones, and the assigning of IDs to them, in some manner. On Wayland we solve
both of these problems at once - when we <em>bind</em> an object ID, we agree on the
interface used for it in all future messages, and stash a mapping of object IDs
to interfaces in our local state.</p>
<p>In order to bootstrap these, the server offers a list of <em>global</em> objects. These
globals often provide information and functionality on their own merits, but
most often they're used to broker additional objects to fulfill various
purposes - such as the creation of application windows. These globals themselves
also have their own object IDs and interfaces, which we have to assign and agree
upon somehow.</p>
<p>With questions of hens and eggs no doubt coming to mind by now, I'll reveal the
secret trick: object ID 1 is already implicitly assigned to the <code>wl_display</code>
interface when you make the connection. As you'll recall the interface, take
note of the <code>wl_display::get_registry</code> request:</p>
<pre><code class="language-xml">&lt;interface name=&quot;wl_display&quot; version=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
  &lt;request name=&quot;sync&quot;&gt;
    &lt;arg name=&quot;callback&quot; type=&quot;new_id&quot; interface=&quot;wl_callback&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/request&gt;

  &lt;request name=&quot;get_registry&quot;&gt;
    &lt;arg name=&quot;registry&quot; type=&quot;new_id&quot; interface=&quot;wl_registry&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/request&gt;

  &lt;!-- cotd --&gt;
&lt;/interface&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>wl_display::get_registry</code> request can be used to bind an object ID to the
<code>wl_registry</code> interface, which is the next one found in <code>wayland.xml</code>. Given
that the <code>wl_display</code> always has object ID 1, the following wire message ought
to make sense (in big-endian):</p>
<pre><code>C-&gt;S    00000001 000C0001 00000002            .... .... ....
</code></pre>
<p>When we break this down, the first number is the object ID. The most significant
16 bits of the second number are the total length of the message in bytes, and
the least significant bits are the request opcode. The remaining words (just
one) are the arguments. In short, this calls request 1 (0-indexed) on object ID
1 (the <code>wl_display</code>), which accepts one argument: a generated ID for a new
object. Note in the XML documentation that this new ID is defined ahead of time
to be governed by the <code>wl_registry</code> interface:</p>
<pre><code class="language-xml">&lt;interface name=&quot;wl_registry&quot; version=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
  &lt;request name=&quot;bind&quot;&gt;
    &lt;arg name=&quot;name&quot; type=&quot;uint&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;arg name=&quot;id&quot; type=&quot;new_id&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/request&gt;

  &lt;event name=&quot;global&quot;&gt;
    &lt;arg name=&quot;name&quot; type=&quot;uint&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;arg name=&quot;interface&quot; type=&quot;string&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;arg name=&quot;version&quot; type=&quot;uint&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/event&gt;

  &lt;event name=&quot;global_remove&quot;&gt;
    &lt;arg name=&quot;name&quot; type=&quot;uint&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/event&gt;
&lt;/interface&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>It is this interface which we'll discuss in the following chapters.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#binding-to-globals" id="binding-to-globals">Binding to globals</a></h1>
<p>Upon creating a registry object, the server will emit the <code>global</code> event for
each global available on the server. You can then bind to the globals you
require.</p>
<p>This process of taking a known object and assigning it an ID is called
<em>binding</em> the object. Once the client binds to the registry like this, the
server emits the <code>global</code> event several times to advertise which interfaces it
supports. Each of these globals is assigned a unique <code>name</code>, as an unsigned
integer. The <code>interface</code> string maps to the name of the interface found in the
protocol: <code>wl_display</code> from the XML above is an example of such a name. The
version number is also defined here - for more information about interface
versioning, see appendix C.</p>
<p>To bind to any of these interfaces, we use the bind request, which works
similarly to the magical process by which we bound to the <code>wl_registry</code>. For
example, consider this wire protocol exchange:</p>
<pre><code>C-&gt;S    00000001 000C0001 00000002            .... .... ....

S-&gt;C    00000002 001C0001 00000001 00000007   .... .... .... ....
        776C5f73 686d0000 00000001            wl_s hm.. ....
        [...]

C-&gt;S    00000002 00100000 00000001 00000003   .... .... .... ....
</code></pre>
<p>The first message is identical to the one we've already dissected. The second
one is an event from the server: object 2 (which the client assigned the
<code>wl_registry</code> to in the first message) opcode 0 (&quot;global&quot;), with arguments 1,
&quot;wl_shm&quot;, and 1 - respectively the name, interface, and version of this global.
The client responds by calling opcode 0 on object ID 2 (<code>wl_registry::bind</code>) and
assigns object ID <code>3</code> to global name <code>1</code> - <em>binding</em> to the <code>wl_shm</code> global.
Future events and requests for this object are defined by the <code>wl_shm</code> protocol,
which you can find in <code>wayland.xml</code>.</p>
<p>Once you've created this object, you can utilize its interface to accomplish
various tasks - in the case of <code>wl_shm</code>, managing shared memory between the
client and server. Most of the remainder of this book is devoted to explaining
the usage of each of these globals.</p>
<p>Armed with this information, we can write our first useful Wayland client: one
which simply prints all of the globals available on the server.</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">#include &lt;stdint.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

<p>Feel free to reference previous chapters to interpret this program. We connect
to the display (chapter 4.1), obtain the registry (this chapter), add a listener
to it (chapter 3.4), then round-trip, handling the global event by printing the
globals available on this compositor. Try it for yourself:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">$ cc -o globals -lwayland-client globals.c
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: this chapter the last time we're going to show wire protocol dumps in
hexadecimal, and probably the last time you'll ever see them in general. A
better way to trace your Wayland client or server is to set the
<code>WAYLAND_DEBUG</code> variable in your environment to <code>1</code> before running your program.
Try it now with the &quot;globals&quot; program!</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#registering-globals" id="registering-globals">Registering globals</a></h1>
<p>Registering globals with libwayland-server is done somewhat differently. When
you generate &quot;server-code&quot; with wayland-scanner, it creates interfaces
(which are analogous to listeners) and glue code for sending events. The first
task is to register the global, with a function to rig up a <em>resource</em><sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup> when
the global is bound. In terms of code, the result looks something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">static void
wl_output_handle_bind(struct wl_client *client, void *data,
    uint32_t version, uint32_t id)
{
    struct my_state *state = data;
    // TODO
}

int
main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    struct wl_display *display = wl_display_create();
    struct my_state state = { ... };
    // ...
    wl_global_create(wl_display, &amp;wl_output_interface,
        1, &amp;my_state, wl_output_handle_bind);
    // ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>If you take this code and, for example, patch it into the server example chapter
4.1, you'll make a <code>wl_output</code> global visible to the &quot;globals&quot; program we wrote
last time<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#2">2</a></sup>. However, any attempts to bind to this global will run into our
TODO. To fill this in, we need to provide an <em>implementation</em> of the <code>wl_output</code>
interface as well.</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">static void
wl_output_handle_resource_destroy(struct wl_resource *resource)
{
    struct my_output *client_output = wl_resource_get_user_data(resource);

    // TODO: Clean up resource

    remove_to_list(client_output-&gt;state-&gt;client_outputs, client_output);
}

static void
wl_output_handle_release(struct wl_client *client, struct wl_resource *resource)
{
    wl_resource_destroy(resource);
}

static const struct wl_output_interface
wl_output_implementation = {
    .release = wl_output_handle_release,
};

static void
wl_output_handle_bind(struct wl_client *client, void *data,
    uint32_t version, uint32_t id)
{
    struct my_state *state = data;

    struct my_output *client_output = calloc(1, sizeof(struct client_output));

    struct wl_resource *resource = wl_resource_create(
        client, &amp;wl_output_implementation, wl_output_interface.version, id);

    wl_resource_set_implementation(resource, wl_output_implementation,
        client_output, wl_output_handle_resource_destroy);

    client_output-&gt;resource = resource;
    client_output-&gt;state = state;

    // TODO: Send geometry event, et al

    add_to_list(state-&gt;client_outputs, client_output);
}
</code></pre>
<p>This is a lot to take in, so let's explain it one piece at a time. At the
bottom, we've extended our &quot;bind&quot; handler to create a <code>wl_resource</code> to track the
server-side state for this object (using the ID that the client allocated). As
we do this, we provide <code>wl_resource_create</code> with a pointer to our implementation
of the interface - <code>wl_output_implementation</code>, a constant static struct in this
file. The type (<code>struct wl_output_interface</code>) is generated by <code>wayland-scanner</code>
and contains one function pointer for each request supported by this interface.
We also take the opportunity to allocate a small container for storing any
additional state we need that libwayland doesn't handle for us, the specific
nature of which varies from protocol to protocol.</p>
<p>Our <code>wl_output_handle_release</code> function is called when the client sends the
<code>release</code> request, indicating that they no longer need this resource - so we
destroy it. This in turn triggers the <code>wl_output_handle_resource_destroy</code>
function, which later we'll extend to free any of the state we allocated for it
earlier. This function is also passed into <code>wl_resource_create</code> as the
destructor, and will be called if the client terminates without explicitly
sending the <code>release</code> request.</p>
<p>The other remaining &quot;TODO&quot; in our code is to send the &quot;name&quot; event, as well as a
few others. If we review <code>wayland.xml</code>, we see this event on the interface:</p>
<pre><code class="language-xml">&lt;event name=&quot;geometry&quot;&gt;
  &lt;description summary=&quot;properties of the output&quot;&gt;
The geometry event describes geometric properties of the output.
The event is sent when binding to the output object and whenever
any of the properties change.

The physical size can be set to zero if it doesn't make sense for this
output (e.g. for projectors or virtual outputs).
  &lt;/description&gt;
  &lt;arg name=&quot;x&quot; type=&quot;int&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;arg name=&quot;y&quot; type=&quot;int&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;arg name=&quot;physical_width&quot; type=&quot;int&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;arg name=&quot;physical_height&quot; type=&quot;int&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;arg name=&quot;subpixel&quot; type=&quot;int&quot; enum=&quot;subpixel&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;arg name=&quot;make&quot; type=&quot;string&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;arg name=&quot;model&quot; type=&quot;string&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;arg name=&quot;transform&quot; type=&quot;int&quot; enum=&quot;transform&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/event&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>It seems to be our responsibility to send this event when the output is bound.
This is easy enough to add:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">static void
wl_output_handle_bind(struct wl_client *client, void *data,
    uint32_t version, uint32_t id)
{
    struct my_state *state = data;

    struct my_output *client_output = calloc(1, sizeof(struct client_output));

    struct wl_resource *resource = wl_resource_create(
        client, &amp;wl_output_implementation, wl_output_interface.version, id);

    wl_resource_set_implementation(resource, wl_output_implementation,
        client_output, wl_output_handle_resource_destroy);

    client_output-&gt;resource = resource;
    client_output-&gt;state = state;

    wl_output_send_geometry(resource, 0, 0, 1920, 1080,
        WL_OUTPUT_SUBPIXEL_UNKNOWN, &quot;Foobar, Inc&quot;,
        &quot;Fancy Monitor 9001 4K HD 120 FPS Noscope&quot;,
        WL_OUTPUT_TRANSFORM_NORMAL);

    add_to_list(state-&gt;client_outputs, client_output);
}
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: <code>wl_output::geometry</code> is shown here for illustrative purposes, but in
practice there are some special considerations for its use. Review the protocol
XML before implementing this event in your client or server.</p>

<h1><a class="header" href="#buffers--surfaces" id="buffers--surfaces">Buffers &amp; surfaces</a></h1>
<p>Apparently, the whole point of this system is to display information to users
and receive their feedback for additional processing. In this chapter, we'll
explore the first of these tasks: showing pixels on the screen.</p>
<p>There are two primitives which are used for this purpose: buffers and surfaces,
governed respectively by the <code>wl_buffer</code> and <code>wl_surface</code> interfaces. Buffers
act as an opaque container for some underlying pixel storage, and are supplied
by clients with a number of methods - shared memory buffers and GPU handles
being the most common.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#using-wl_compositor" id="using-wl_compositor">Using wl_compositor</a></h1>
<p>They say naming things is one of the most difficult problems in computer
science, and here we are, with evidence in hand. The <code>wl_compositor</code> global is
the Wayland compositor's, er, compositor. Through this interface, you may
send the server your windows for presentation, to be <em>composited</em> with the
other windows being shown alongside it. The compositor has two jobs: the
creation of surfaces and regions.</p>
<p>To quote the spec, a Wayland <em>surface</em> has a rectangular area which may be
displayed on zero or more outputs, present buffers, receive user input, and
define a local coordinate system. We'll take all of these apart in detail later,
but let's start with the basics: obtaining a surface and attaching a buffer to
it. To obtain a surface, we first bind to the <code>wl_compositor</code> global. By
extending the example from chapter 5.1 we get the following:</p>
<pre><code>struct our_state {
    // ...
    struct wl_compositor *compositor;
    // ...
};

static void
registry_handle_global(void *data, struct wl_registry *wl_registry,
		uint32_t name, const char *interface, uint32_t version)
{
    struct our_state *state = data;
    if (strcmp(interface, wl_compositor_interface.name) == 0) {
        state-&gt;compositor = wl_registry_bind(
            wl_registry, name, &amp;wl_compositor_interface, 4);
    }
}

int
main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    struct our_state state = { 0 };
    // ...
    wl_registry_add_listener(registry, &amp;registry_listener, &amp;state);
    // ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>Note that we've specified version 4 when calling <code>wl_registry_bind</code>, which is
the latest version at the time of writing. With this reference secured, we can
create a <code>wl_surface</code>:</p>
<pre><code>struct wl_surface *surface = wl_compositor_create_surface(state.compositor);
</code></pre>
<p>Before we can present it, we must first attach a source of pixels to it: a
<code>wl_buffer</code>.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#shared-memory-buffers" id="shared-memory-buffers">Shared memory buffers</a></h1>
<p>The simplest means of getting pixels from client to compositor, and the only one
enshrined in <code>wayland.xml</code>, is <code>wl_shm</code> - shared memory. Simply put, it allows
you to transfer a file descriptor for the compositor to mmap with <code>MAP_SHARED</code>,
then share pixel buffers out of this pool. Add some simple synchronization
primitives to keep everyone from fighting over each buffer, and you have a
workable - and portable - solution.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#binding-to-wl_shm" id="binding-to-wl_shm">Binding to wl_shm</a></h2>
<p>The registry global listener explained in chapter 5.1 will advertise the
<code>wl_shm</code> global when it's available. Binding to it is fairly straightforward.
Extending the example given in chapter 5.1, we get the following:</p>
<pre><code>struct our_state {
    // ...
    struct wl_shm *shm;
    // ...
};

static void
registry_handle_global(void *data, struct wl_registry *registry,
		uint32_t name, const char *interface, uint32_t version)
{
    struct our_state *state = data;
    if (strcmp(interface, wl_shm_interface.name) == 0) {
        state-&gt;shm = wl_registry_bind(
            wl_registry, name, &amp;wl_shm_interface, 1);
    }
}

int
main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    struct our_state state = { 0 };
    // ...
    wl_registry_add_listener(registry, &amp;registry_listener, &amp;state);
    // ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>Once bound, we can optionally add a listener via <code>wl_shm_add_listener</code>. The
compositor will advertise its supported pixel formats via this listener. The
full list of possible pixel formats is given in <code>wayland.xml</code>. Two formats are
required to be supported: <code>ARGB8888</code>, and <code>XRGB8888</code>, which are 24-bit color,
with and without an alpha channel respectively.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#allocating-a-shared-memory-pool" id="allocating-a-shared-memory-pool">Allocating a shared memory pool</a></h2>
<p>A combination of POSIX <code>shm_open</code> and random file names can be utilized to
create a file suitable for this purpose, and <code>ftruncate</code> can be utilized to
bring it up to the appropriate size. The following boilerplate may be freely
used under public domain or CC0:</p>

		return -1;
	}
	return fd;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Hopefully the code is fairly self-explanatory (famous last words). Armed with
this, the client can create a shared memory pool fairly easily. Let's say, for
example, that we want to show a 1920x1080 window. We'll need two buffers for
double-buffering, so that'll be 4,147,200 pixels. Assuming the pixel format is
<code>WL_SHM_FORMAT_XRGB8888</code>, that'll be 4 bytes to the pixel, for a total pool size
of 16,588,800 bytes. Bind to the <code>wl_shm</code> global from the registry as explained
in chapter 5.1, then use it like so to create an shm pool which can hold these
buffers:</p>
<pre><code>const int width = 1920, height = 1080;
const int stride = width * 4;
const int shm_pool_size = height * stride * 2;

int fd = allocate_shm_file(shm_pool_size);
uint8_t *pool_data = mmap(NULL, size,
    PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE, MAP_SHARED, fd, 0);

struct wl_shm *shm = ...; // Bound from registry
struct wl_shm_pool *pool = wl_shm_create_pool(shm, fd, shm_pool_size);
</code></pre>
<h2><a class="header" href="#creating-buffers-from-a-pool" id="creating-buffers-from-a-pool">Creating buffers from a pool</a></h2>
<p>Once word of this gets to the compositor, it will <code>mmap</code> this file descriptor as
well. Wayland is asynchronous, though, so we can start allocating buffers from
this pool right away. Since we allocated space for two buffers, we can assign
each an index and convert that index into a byte offset in the pool. Equipped
with this information, we can create a <code>wl_buffer</code>:</p>
<pre><code>int index = 0;
int offset = height * stride * index;
struct wl_buffer *buffer = wl_shm_pool_create_buffer(pool, offset,
    width, height, stride, WL_SHM_FORMAT_XRGB8888);
</code></pre>
<p>We can write an image to this buffer now as well. For example, to set it to
solid white:</p>
<pre><code>uint32_t *pixels = (uint32_t *)&amp;pool_data[offset];
memset(pixels, 0, width * height * 4);
</code></pre>
<p>Or, for something more interesting, here's a checkerboard pattern:</p>
<pre><code>uint32_t *pixels = (uint32_t *)&amp;pool_data[offset];
for (int y = 0; y &lt; height; ++y) {
  for (int x = 0; x &lt; width; ++x) {
    if ((x + y / 8 * 8) % 16 &lt; 8) {
      pixels[y * width + x] = 0xFF666666;
    } else {
      pixels[y * width + x] = 0xFFEEEEEE;
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>With the stage set, we'll attach our buffer to our surface, mark the whole
surface as damaged<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup>, and commit it:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">wl_surface_attach(surface, buffer, 0, 0);
wl_surface_damage(surface, 0, 0, UINT32_MAX, UINT32_MAX);
wl_surface_commit(surface);
</code></pre>
<p>If you were to apply all of this newfound knowledge to writing a Wayland client
yourself, you may arrive at this point confused when your buffer is not shown
on-screen. We're missing a critical final step - assigning your surface a role.</p>
<div class="footnote-definition" id="1"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">1</sup>

<h2><a class="header" href="#wl_shm-on-the-server" id="wl_shm-on-the-server">wl_shm on the server</a></h2>
<p>Before we get there, however, the server-side part of this deserves note.
libwayland provides some helpers to make using <code>wl_shm</code> easier. To configure it
for your display, it only requires the following:</p>
<pre><code>int
wl_display_init_shm(struct wl_display *display);

uint32_t *
wl_display_add_shm_format(struct wl_display *display, uint32_t format);
</code></pre>
<p>The former creates the global and rigs up the internal implementation, and the
latter adds a supported pixel format (remember to at least add ARGB8888 and
XRGB8888). Once a client attaches a buffer to one of its surfaces, you can pass
the buffer resource into <code>wl_shm_buffer_get</code> to obtain a <code>wl_shm_buffer</code>
reference, and utilize it like so:</p>
<pre><code>void
wl_shm_buffer_begin_access(struct wl_shm_buffer *buffer);

void
wl_shm_buffer_end_access(struct wl_shm_buffer *buffer);

void *
wl_shm_buffer_get_data(struct wl_shm_buffer *buffer);

int32_t
wl_shm_buffer_get_stride(struct wl_shm_buffer *buffer);

uint32_t
wl_shm_buffer_get_format(struct wl_shm_buffer *buffer);

int32_t
wl_shm_buffer_get_width(struct wl_shm_buffer *buffer);

int32_t
wl_shm_buffer_get_height(struct wl_shm_buffer *buffer);
</code></pre>
<p>If you guard your accesses to the buffer data with <code>begin_access</code> and
<code>end_access</code>, libwayland will take care of locking for you.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#linux-dmabuf" id="linux-dmabuf">Linux dmabuf</a></h1>
<!-- TODO: Move me to an appendix -->
<p>Most Wayland compositors do their rendering on the GPU, and many Wayland clients
do their rendering on the GPU as well. With the shared memory approach, sending
buffers from the client to the compositor in such cases is very inefficient, as
the client has to read their data from the GPU to the CPU, then the compositor
has to read it from the CPU back to the GPU to be rendered.</p>
<p>The Linux DRM (Direct Rendering Manager) interface (which is also implemented on
some BSDs) provides a means for us to export handles to GPU resources. Mesa, the
predominant implementation of userspace Linux graphics drivers, implements a
protocol that allows EGL users to transfer handles to their GPU buffers from the
client to the compositor for rendering, without ever copying data to the GPU.</p>
<p>The internals of how this protocol works are out of scope for this book and
would be more appropriate for resources which focus on Mesa or Linux DRM in
particular. However, we can provide a short summary of its use.</p>
<ol>
<li>Use <code>eglGetPlatformDisplayEXT</code> in concert with <code>EGL_PLATFORM_WAYLAND_KHR</code> to
create an EGL display.</li>
<li>Configure the display normally, choosing a config appropriate to your
circumstances with <code>EGL_SURFACE_TYPE</code> set to <code>EGL_WINDOW_BIT</code>.</li>
<li>Use <code>wl_egl_window_create</code> to create a <code>wl_egl_window</code> for a given
<code>wl_surface</code>.</li>
<li>Use <code>eglCreatePlatformWindowSurfaceEXT</code> to create an <code>EGLSurface</code> for a
<code>wl_egl_window</code>.</li>
<li>Proceed using EGL normally, e.g. <code>eglMakeCurrent</code> to make current the EGL
context for your surface and <code>eglSwapBuffers</code> to send an up-to-date buffer to
the compositor and commit the surface.</li>
</ol>
<p>Should you need to change the size of the <code>wl_egl_window</code> later, use
<code>wl_egl_window_resize</code>.</p>

<p>Some Wayland programmers who don't use libwayland complain that this approach
ties Mesa and libwayland tightly together, which is true. However, untangling
them is not impossible - it just requires a lot of work for you in the form of
implementing <code>linux-dmabuf</code> yourself. Consult the Wayland extension XML for
details on the protocol, and Mesa's implementation at

<h1><a class="header" href="#surface-roles" id="surface-roles">Surface roles</a></h1>
<p>We have created a pixel buffer, sent it to the server, and attached it to a
surface through which we can allegedly present it to the user. However, one
crucial piece is missing to imbue the surface with meaning: its role.</p>
<p>There are a lot of different situations where a pixel buffer might be presented
to the user, and each calls for different semantics. Some examples include
application windows, sure, but others include a cursor image or your desktop
wallpaper. To contrast the semantics of application windows with cursors,
consider that your cursor cannot be minimized, and application windows should
not be stuck to the mouse. For this reason, <em>roles</em> provide another layer of
abstraction which allows you to assign the appropriate semantics to the surface.</p>
<p>The role you're probably dying to assign to it, 6 chapters in, is an application
window. The following chapter introduces the mechanism by which this is
achieved: XDG shell.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#xdg-shell-basics" id="xdg-shell-basics">XDG shell basics</a></h1>
<p>The XDG (cross-desktop group) shell is a standard protocol extension for Wayland
which describes the semantics for application windows. It defines two
<code>wl_surface</code> roles: &quot;toplevel&quot;, for your top-level application windows, and
&quot;popup&quot;, for things like context menus, dropdown menus, tooltips, and so on -
which are children of top-level windows. With these together, you can form a
tree of surfaces, with a toplevel at the top and popups or additional toplevels
at the leaves. The protocol also defines a <em>positioner</em> interface, which is used
for help positioning popups with limited information about the things around
your window.</p>
<p>xdg-shell, as a protocol <em>extension</em>, is not defined in <code>wayland.xml</code>. Instead
you'll find it in the <code>wayland-protocols</code> package. It's probably installed at a
path somewhat like <code>/usr/share/wayland-protocols/stable/xdg-shell/xdg-shell.xml</code>
on your system.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#xdg_wm_base" id="xdg_wm_base">xdg_wm_base</a></h2>
<p><code>xdg_wm_base</code> is the only global defined by the specification, and it provides
requests for creating each of the other objects you need. The most basic
implementation starts by handling the &quot;ping&quot; event - when the compositor sends
it, you should respond with a &quot;pong&quot; request in a timely manner to hint that you
haven't become deadlocked. Another request deals with the creation of
positioners, the objects mentioned earlier, and we'll save the details on these
for chapter 10. The request we want to look into first is <code>get_xdg_surface</code>.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#xdg-surfaces" id="xdg-surfaces">XDG surfaces</a></h1>
<p>Surfaces in the domain of xdg-shell are referred to as <code>xdg_surfaces</code>, and this
interface brings with it a small amount of functionality common to both kinds of
XDG surfaces - toplevels and popups. The semantics for each kind of XDG
surface are different enough still that they must be specified explicitly
through an additional role.</p>
<p>The <code>xdg_surface</code> interface provides additional requests for assigning the more
specific roles of popup and toplevel. Once we've bound an object to the
<code>xdg_wm_base</code> global, we can use the <code>get_xdg_surface</code> request to obtain one for
a <code>wl_surface</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-xml">&lt;request name=&quot;get_xdg_surface&quot;&gt;
  &lt;arg name=&quot;id&quot; type=&quot;new_id&quot; interface=&quot;xdg_surface&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;arg name=&quot;surface&quot; type=&quot;object&quot; interface=&quot;wl_surface&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/request&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>xdg_surface</code> interface, in addition to requests for assigning a more
specific role of toplevel or popup to your surface, also includes some important
functionality common to both roles. Let's review these before we move on to the
toplevel- and popup-specific semantics.</p>
<pre><code class="language-xml">&lt;event name=&quot;configure&quot;&gt;
  &lt;arg name=&quot;serial&quot; type=&quot;uint&quot; summary=&quot;serial of the configure event&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/event&gt;

&lt;request name=&quot;ack_configure&quot;&gt;
  &lt;arg name=&quot;serial&quot; type=&quot;uint&quot; summary=&quot;the serial from the configure event&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/request&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The most important API of xdg-surface is this pair: <code>configure</code> and
<code>ack_configure</code>. You may recall that a goal of Wayland is to make every frame
perfect. That means no frames are shown with a half-applied state change, and to
accomplish this we have to synchronize these changes between the client and
server. For XDG surfaces, this pair of requests is the mechanism which supports
this.</p>
<p>We're only covering the basics for now, so we'll summarize the importance of
these two events as such: as events from the server inform your configuration
(or reconfiguration) of a surface, apply them to a pending state. When a
<code>configure</code> event arrives, apply the pending changes, use <code>ack_configure</code> to
acknowledge you've done so, and render and commit a new frame. We'll show this
in practice in the next chapter, and explain it in detail in chapter 8.1.</p>
<pre><code class="language-xml">&lt;request name=&quot;set_window_geometry&quot;&gt;
  &lt;arg name=&quot;x&quot; type=&quot;int&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;arg name=&quot;y&quot; type=&quot;int&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;arg name=&quot;width&quot; type=&quot;int&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;arg name=&quot;height&quot; type=&quot;int&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/request&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>set_window_geometry</code> request is used primarily for applications using
client-side decorations, to distinguish the parts of their surface which are
considered a part of the window, and the parts which are not. Most commonly,
this is used to exclude client-side drop-shadows rendered behind the window from
being considered a part of it. The compositor may apply this information to
govern its own behaviors for arranging and interacting with the window.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#application-windows" id="application-windows">Application windows</a></h1>
<p>We have shaved many yaks to get here, but it's time: XDG toplevel is the
interface which we will finally use to display an application window. The XDG
toplevel interface has many requests and events for managing application
windows, including dealing with minimized and maximized states, setting window
titles, and so on. We'll be discussing each part of it in detail in future
chapters, so let's just concern ourselves with the basics now.</p>
<p>Based on our knowledge from the last chapter, we know that we can obtain an
<code>xdg_surface</code> from a <code>wl_surface</code>, but that it only constitutes the first step:
bringing a surface into the fold of XDG shell. The next step is to turn that XDG
surface into an XDG toplevel — a &quot;top-level&quot; application window, so named
for its top-level position in the hierarchy of windows and popup menus we will
eventually create with XDG shell. To create one of these, we can use the
appropriate request from the <code>xdg_surface</code> interface:</p>
<pre><code class="language-xml">&lt;request name=&quot;get_toplevel&quot;&gt;
  &lt;arg name=&quot;id&quot; type=&quot;new_id&quot; interface=&quot;xdg_toplevel&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/request&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>This new <code>xdg_toplevel</code> interface puts many requests and events at our disposal
for managing the lifecycle of application windows. Chapter 10 explores these in
depth, but I know you're itching to get something on-screen. If you follow these
steps, handling the <code>configure</code> and <code>ack_configure</code> riggings for XDG surface
discussed in the previous chapter, and attach and commit a <code>wl_buffer</code> to our
<code>wl_surface</code>, an application window will appear and present your buffer's
contents to the user. Example code which does just this is provided in the next
chapter. It also leverages one additional XDG toplevel request which we haven't
covered yet:</p>
<pre><code class="language-xml">&lt;request name=&quot;set_title&quot;&gt;
  &lt;arg name=&quot;title&quot; type=&quot;string&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/request&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>This should be fairly self-explanatory. There's a similar one that we don't use
in the example code, but which may be appropriate for your application:</p>
<pre><code class="language-xml">&lt;request name=&quot;set_app_id&quot;&gt;
  &lt;arg name=&quot;app_id&quot; type=&quot;string&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/request&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The title is often shown in window decorations, tasksbars, etc, whereas the app
ID is used to identify your application or group your windows together. You
might utilize these by setting your window title to &quot;Application windows - The
Wayland Protocol - Firefox&quot;, and your app ID to &quot;firefox&quot;.</p>
<p>In summary, the following steps will take you from zero to a window on-screen:</p>
<ol>
<li>Bind to <code>wl_compositor</code> and use it to create a <code>wl_surface</code>.</li>
<li>Bind to <code>xdg_wm_base</code> and use it to create an <code>xdg_surface</code> with your
<code>wl_surface</code>.</li>
<li>Create an <code>xdg_toplevel</code> from the <code>xdg_surface</code> with
<code>xdg_surface.get_toplevel</code>.</li>
<li>Configure a listener for the <code>xdg_surface</code> and await the <code>configure</code> event.</li>
<li>Bind to the buffer allocation mechanism of your choosing (such as <code>wl_shm</code>)
and allocate a shared buffer, then render your content to it.</li>
<li>Use <code>wl_surface.attach</code> to attach the <code>wl_buffer</code> to the <code>wl_surface</code>.</li>
<li>Use <code>xdg_surface.ack_configure</code>, passing it the serial from <code>configure</code>,
acknowledging that you have prepared a suitable frame.</li>
<li>Send a <code>wl_surface.commit</code> request.</li>
</ol>
<p>Turn the page to see these steps in action.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#extended-example-code" id="extended-example-code">Extended example code</a></h1>
<p>Using the sum of what we've learned so far, we can now write a Wayland client
which displays something on the screen. The following code is a complete Wayland
application which opens an XDG toplevel window and shows a 640x480 grid of
squares on it. Compile it like so:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">wayland-scanner private-code \
  &lt; /usr/share/wayland-protocols/stable/xdg-shell/xdg-shell.xml \
  &gt; xdg-shell-protocol.c
wayland-scanner client-header \
  &lt; /usr/share/wayland-protocols/stable/xdg-shell/xdg-shell.xml \
  &gt; xdg-shell-client-protocol.h
cc -o client client.c xdg-shell-protocol.c -lwayland-client -lrt
</code></pre>
<p>Then run <code>./client</code> to see it in action, or <code>WAYLAND_DEBUG=1 ./client</code> to
include a bunch of useful debugging information. Tada! In future chapters we
will be building upon this client, so stow this code away somewhere safe.</p>

<h1><a class="header" href="#surfaces-in-depth" id="surfaces-in-depth">Surfaces in depth</a></h1>
<p>The basic areas of the surface interface that we've shown until now are
sufficient to present data to the user, but the surface interface offers many
additional requests and events for more efficient use. Many - if not most -
applications do not need to redraw the entire surface each frame. Even deciding
<em>when</em> to draw the next frame is best done with the assistance of the
compositor. In this chapter, we'll explore the features of <code>wl_surface</code> in
depth.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#surface-lifecycle" id="surface-lifecycle">Surface lifecycle</a></h1>
<p>We mentioned earlier that Wayland is designed to update everything atomically,
such that no frame is ever presented in an invalid or intermediate state. Of the
many attributes that can be configured for an application window and other
surfaces, the driving mechanism behind that atomicity is the <code>wl_surface</code>
itself.</p>
<p>Every surface has a <em>pending</em> state and an <em>applied</em> state, and no state at all
when it's first created. The <em>pending</em> state is negotiated over the course of
any number of requests from clients and events from the server, and when both
sides agree that it represents a consistent surface state, the surface is
<em>committed</em> - and the pending state is <em>applied</em> to the current state of the
surface. Until this time, the compositor will continue to render the last
consistent state; once committed, will use the new state from the next frame
forward.</p>
<p>Among the state which is updated atomically are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The attached <code>wl_buffer</code>, or the pixels making up the content of the surface</li>
<li>The region which was &quot;damaged&quot; since the last frame, and needs to be redrawn</li>
<li>The region which accepts input events</li>
<li>The region considered opaque<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup></li>
<li>Transformations on the attached <code>wl_buffer</code>, to rotate or present a subset of
the buffer</li>
<li>The scale factor of the buffer, used for HiDPI displays</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to these features of the surface, the surface's <em>role</em> may have
additional double-buffered state like this. All of this state, along with any
state associated with the role, is applied when <code>wl_surface.commit</code> is sent. You
can send these requests several times if you change your mind, and only the most
recent value for any of these properties will be considered when the surface is
eventually committed.</p>
<p>When you first create your surface, the initial state is invalid. To make it
valid (or to <em>map</em> the surface), you need to provide the necessary information
to build the first consistent state for that surface. This includes giving it a
role (like <code>xdg_toplevel</code>), allocating and attaching a buffer, and configuring
any role-specific state for that surface. When you send a <code>wl_surface.commit</code>
with this state correctly configured, the surface becomes valid (or <em>mapped</em>)
and will be presented by the compositor.</p>
<p>The next question is: when should I prepare a new frame?</p>
<div class="footnote-definition" id="1"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">1</sup>
<p>This is used by the compositor for optimization purposes.</p>
</div>
<h1><a class="header" href="#frame-callbacks" id="frame-callbacks">Frame callbacks</a></h1>
<p>The simplest way to update your surface is to simply render and attach new
frames when it needs to change. This approach works well, for example, with
event-driven applications. The user presses a key and the textbox needs to be
re-rendered, so you can just re-render it immediately, damage the appropriate
area, and attach a new buffer to be presented on the next frame.</p>
<p>However, some applications may want to render frames continuously. You might be
rendering frames of a video game, playing back a video, or rendering an
animation. Your display has an inherent <em>refresh rate</em>, or the fastest rate at
which it's able to display updates (generally this is a number like 60 Hz, 144
Hz, etc). It doesn't make sense to render frames any faster than this, and doing
so would be a waste of resources - CPU, GPU, even the user's battery. If you
send several frames between each display refresh, all but the last will be
discarded and have been rendered for naught.</p>
<p>Additionally, the compositor might not even want to show new frames for you.
Your application might be off-screen, minimized, or hidden behind other windows;
or only a small thumbnail of your application is being shown, so they might want
to render you at a slower framerate to conserve resources. For this reason, the
best way to continuously render frames in a Wayland client is to let the
compositor tell you when it's ready for a new frame: using <em>frame callbacks</em>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-xml">&lt;interface name=&quot;wl_surface&quot; version=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
  &lt;!-- ... --&gt;

  &lt;request name=&quot;frame&quot;&gt;
    &lt;arg name=&quot;callback&quot; type=&quot;new_id&quot; interface=&quot;wl_callback&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/request&gt;

  &lt;!-- ... --&gt;
&lt;/interface&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>This request will allocate a <code>wl_callback</code> object, which has a pretty simple
interface:</p>
<pre><code class="language-xml">&lt;interface name=&quot;wl_callback&quot; version=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
  &lt;event name=&quot;done&quot;&gt;
    &lt;arg name=&quot;callback_data&quot; type=&quot;uint&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/event&gt;
&lt;/interface&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>When you request a frame callback on a surface, the compositor will send a
<code>done</code> event to the callback object once it's ready for a new frame for this
surface. In the case of <code>frame</code> events, the <code>callback_data</code> is set to the
current time in millisecond, from an unspecified epoch. You can compare this
with your last frame to calculate the progress of an animation or to scale input
events.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup></p>
<p>With frame callbacks in our toolbelt, why don't we update our application from
chapter 7.2 so it scrolls a bit each frame? Let's start by adding a little bit

<ol>
<li>Destroy the now-used frame callback.</li>
<li>Request a new callback for the next frame.</li>

last frame, resulting in a nice tear-free experience. Compile and run the
updated client to try it out for yourself!</p>
<div class="footnote-definition" id="1"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">1</sup>

</div>
<h1><a class="header" href="#damaging-surfaces" id="damaging-surfaces">Damaging surfaces</a></h1>
<p>You may have noticed in the last example that we added this line of code when we
committed a new frame for the surface:</p>
<pre><code>wl_surface_damage_buffer(state-&gt;wl_surface, 0, 0, INT32_MAX, INT32_MAX);
</code></pre>
<p>If so, sharp eye! This code <em>damages</em> our surface, indicating to the compositor
that it needs to be redrawn. Here we damage the entire surface (and well beyond
it), but we could instead only damage part of it.</p>
<p>Let's say, for example, that you've written a GUI toolkit and the user is typing
into a textbox. That textbox probably only takes up a small part of the window,
and each new character takes up a smaller part still. When the user presses a
key, you could render just the new character appended to the text they're
writing, then damage only that part of the surface. The compositor can then copy
just a fraction of your surface, which can speed things up considerably -
especially for embedded devices. As you blink the caret between characters,
you'll want to submit damage for its updates, and when the user changes views,
you'll likely damage the entire surface. This way, everyone does less work, and
the user will thank you for their improved battery life.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: The Wayland protocol provides two requests for damaging surfaces:
<code>damage</code> and <code>damage_buffer</code>. The former is effectively deprecated, and you
should only use the latter. The difference between them is that <code>damage</code> takes
into account all of the transforms affecting the surface, such as rotations,
scale factor, and buffer position and clipping. The latter instead applies
damage relative to the buffer, which is generally easier to reason about.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#surface-regions" id="surface-regions">Surface regions</a></h1>
<p>We've already used the <code>wl_compositor</code> interface to create <code>wl_surfaces</code> via
<code>wl_compositor.create_surface</code>. Note, however, that it has a second request:
<code>create_region</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-xml">&lt;interface name=&quot;wl_compositor&quot; version=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
  &lt;request name=&quot;create_surface&quot;&gt;
    &lt;arg name=&quot;id&quot; type=&quot;new_id&quot; interface=&quot;wl_surface&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/request&gt;

  &lt;request name=&quot;create_region&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/request&gt;
&lt;/interface&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>wl_region</code> interface defines a group of rectangles, which collectively make
up an arbitrarily shaped region of geometry. Its requests allow you to do
bitwise operations against the geometry it defines by adding or subtracting
rectangles from it.</p>

&lt;/interface&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>To make, for example, a rectangle with a hole in it, you could:</p>
<ol>
<li>Send <code>wl_compositor.create_region</code> to allocate a <code>wl_region</code> object.</li>
<li>Send <code>wl_region.add(0, 0, 512, 512)</code> to create a 512x512 rectangle.</li>
<li>Send <code>wl_region.subtract(128, 128, 256, 256)</code> to remove a 256x256 rectangle
from the middle of the region.</li>
</ol>
<p>These areas can be disjoint as well; it needn't be a single continuous polygon.
Once you've created one of these regions, you can pass it into the <code>wl_surface</code>
interface, namely with the <code>set_opaque_region</code> and <code>set_input_region</code> requests.</p>
<pre><code class="language-xml">&lt;interface name=&quot;wl_surface&quot; version=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
  &lt;request name=&quot;set_opaque_region&quot;&gt;
    &lt;arg name=&quot;region&quot; type=&quot;object&quot; interface=&quot;wl_region&quot; allow-null=&quot;true&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/request&gt;

  &lt;request name=&quot;set_input_region&quot;&gt;
    &lt;arg name=&quot;region&quot; type=&quot;object&quot; interface=&quot;wl_region&quot; allow-null=&quot;true&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/request&gt;
&lt;/interface&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The opaque region is a hint to the compositor as to which parts of your surface
are considered opaque. Based on this information, they can optimize their
rendering process. For example, if your surface is completely opaque and
occludes another window beneath it, then the compositor won't waste any time on
redrawing the window beneath yours. By default, this is empty, which assumes
that any part of your surface might be transparent. This makes the default case
the least efficient but the most correct.</p>
<p>The input region indicates which parts of your surface accept pointer and touch
input events. You might, for example, draw a drop-shadow underneath your
surface, but input events which happen in this region should be passed to the
client beneath you. Or, if your window is an unusual shape, you could create an
input region in that shape. For most surface types by default, your entire
surface accepts input.</p>
<p>Both of these requests can be used to set an empty region by passing in null
instead of a <code>wl_region</code> object. They're also both double-buffered - so send a
<code>wl_surface.commit</code> to make your changes effective. You can destroy the
<code>wl_region</code> object to free up its resources as soon as you've sent the
<code>set_opaque_region</code> or <code>set_input_region</code> requests with it. Updating the region
after you send these requests will not update the state of the surface.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#subsurfaces" id="subsurfaces">Subsurfaces</a></h1>
<p>There's only one<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup> surface role defined in the core Wayland protocol,
<code>wayland.xml</code>: subsurfaces. Subsurfaces are surfaces shown on top of their
parent surface. They have a position relative to the parent surface - which
needn't be constrained by the bounds of their parent surface - and a z-order
relative to each other.</p>
<p>Some use-cases for this feature include playing a video surface in its native
pixel format with an RGBA user-interface or subtitles shown on top, using an
OpenGL surface for your primary application interface and using subsurfaces to
render window decorations in software, or moving around parts of the UI without
having to redraw on the client. With the assistance of hardware planes, the
compositor, too, might not even have to redraw anything for updates your
subsurfaces. On embedded systems in particular, this can be especially useful
when it fits your use-case.  A cleverly designed application can take advantage
of subsurfaces to be very efficient.</p>
<p>The interface for managing these is the <code>wl_subcompositor</code> interface. The
<code>get_subsurface</code> request is the main entry-point to the subcompositor:</p>
<pre><code class="language-xml">&lt;request name=&quot;get_subsurface&quot;&gt;
  &lt;arg name=&quot;id&quot; type=&quot;new_id&quot; interface=&quot;wl_subsurface&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;arg name=&quot;surface&quot; type=&quot;object&quot; interface=&quot;wl_surface&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;arg name=&quot;parent&quot; type=&quot;object&quot; interface=&quot;wl_surface&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/request&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Once you have a <code>wl_subsurface</code> object associated with a <code>wl_surface</code>, it
becomes a child of that surface. Subsurfaces can themselves have subsurfaces,
resulting in an ordered tree of surfaces beneath any top-level surface.
Manipulating these children is done through the <code>wl_subsurface</code> interface:</p>
<pre><code class="language-xml">&lt;request name=&quot;set_position&quot;&gt;
  &lt;arg name=&quot;x&quot; type=&quot;int&quot; summary=&quot;x coordinate in the parent surface&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;arg name=&quot;y&quot; type=&quot;int&quot; summary=&quot;y coordinate in the parent surface&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/request&gt;

&lt;request name=&quot;place_above&quot;&gt;
  &lt;arg name=&quot;sibling&quot; type=&quot;object&quot; interface=&quot;wl_surface&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/request&gt;

&lt;request name=&quot;place_below&quot;&gt;
  &lt;arg name=&quot;sibling&quot; type=&quot;object&quot; interface=&quot;wl_surface&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/request&gt;

&lt;request name=&quot;set_sync&quot; /&gt;
&lt;request name=&quot;set_desync&quot; /&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The position and z-order requests here are fairly self-explanatory. However,
the synchronization of the various properties of a <code>wl_subsurface</code> requires some
explanation. These position and z-order properties are synchronized with the
parent surface's lifecycle. When a <code>wl_surface.commit</code> request is sent for the
main surface, all of its subsurfaces have changes to their position and z-order
applied with it.</p>
<p>However, the <code>wl_surface</code> state associated with this subsurface, such as the
attachment of buffers and accumulation of damage, need not be linked to the
parent surface's lifecycle. This is the purpose of the <code>set_sync</code> and
<code>set_desync</code> requests. Subsurfaces synced with their parent surface will commit
all of their state when the parent surface is committed. Desynced surfaces will
manage their own commit lifecycle like any other.</p>
<p>In short, the sync and desync requests are non-buffered and apply immediately.
The position and z-order requests are buffered, and are not affected by the
sync/desync property of the surface - they are always committed with the parent
surface. The remaining surface state, on the associated <code>wl_surface</code>, is
committed in accordance with the sync/desync status of the subsurface.</p>

<p>Disregarding the deprecated <code>wl_shell</code> interface.</p>
</div>
<h1><a class="header" href="#high-density-surfaces-hidpi" id="high-density-surfaces-hidpi">High density surfaces (HiDPI)</a></h1>
<p>In the past several years, a huge leap in pixel density in high-end displays has
been seen, new displays packing twice as many pixels into the same physical area
as we've seen in years past. We call these displays &quot;HiDPI&quot;, short for &quot;high
dots per inch&quot;. However, these displays are so far ahead of their &quot;LoDPI&quot; peers
that application-level changes are necessary to utilize them properly. By
doubling the screen resolution in the same space, we would halve the size of all
of our user interfaces if we lent them no special consideration. For most
displays, this would make the text unreadable and the interactive elements
uncomfortably small.</p>
<p>In exchange, however, we're offered a much greater amount of graphical fidelity
with our vector graphics, most notably with respect to text rendering. Wayland
addresses this by adding a &quot;scale factor&quot; to each output, and clients are
expected to apply this scale factor to their interfaces. Additionally, clients
which are unaware of HiDPI signal this limitation through inaction, allowing the
compositor to make up for it by scaling up their buffers. The compositor signals
the scale factor for each output via the appropriate event:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;interface name=&quot;wl_output&quot; version=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
  &lt;!-- ... --&gt;
  &lt;event name=&quot;scale&quot; since=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
    &lt;arg name=&quot;factor&quot; type=&quot;int&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/event&gt;
&lt;/interface&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Note that this was added in version 2, so when binding to the <code>wl_output</code> global
you must set the version to at least 2 to receive these events. This is <em>not</em>
enough to decide to use HiDPI in your clients, however. In order to make that
call, the compositor must also send <code>enter</code> events for your <code>wl_surface</code> to
indicate that it has &quot;entered&quot; (is being shown on) a particular output or
outputs:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;interface name=&quot;wl_surface&quot; version=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
  &lt;!-- ... --&gt;
  &lt;event name=&quot;enter&quot;&gt;
    &lt;arg name=&quot;output&quot; type=&quot;object&quot; interface=&quot;wl_output&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/event&gt;
&lt;/interface&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Once you know the collection of outputs a client is shown on, it should take the
maximum value of the scale factors, multiply the size (in pixels) of its buffers
by this value, then render the UI at 2x or 3x (or Nx) scale. Then, indicate the
scale the buffer was prepared at like so:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;interface name=&quot;wl_surface&quot; version=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
  &lt;!-- ... --&gt;
  &lt;request name=&quot;set_buffer_scale&quot; since=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
    &lt;arg name=&quot;scale&quot; type=&quot;int&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/request&gt;
&lt;/interface&gt;
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: this requires version 3 or newer of <code>wl_surface</code>. This is the version
number you should pass to the <code>wl_registry</code> when you bind to <code>wl_compositor</code>.</p>
<p>Upon the next <code>wl_surface.commit</code>, your surface will assume this scale factor.
If it's greater than the scale factor of an output the surface is shown on, the
compositor will scale it down. If it's less than the scale factor of an output,
the compositor will scale it up.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#seats-handling-input" id="seats-handling-input">Seats: Handling input</a></h1>
<p>Displaying your application to the user is only half of the I/O equation —
most applications also need to process input. For this purpose, the seat
provides an abstraction over input events on Wayland. In philosophical terms, a
Wayland seat refers to one &quot;seat&quot; at which a user sits and operates the
computer, and is associated with up to one keyboard and up to one &quot;pointer&quot;
device (i.e. a mouse or touchpad). A similar relationship is defined for
touchscreens, drawing tablet devices, and so on.</p>
<p>It's important to remember that this is an <em>abstraction</em>, and that the seats
represented on a Wayland display may not correspond 1:1 with reality. In
practice, it's rare for more than a single seat to be available on a Wayland
session. If you plug a second keyboard into your computer, it's generally
assigned to the same seat as the first, and the keyboard layout and so on are
dynamically switched as you start typing on each. These implementation details
are left to the Wayland compositor to consider.</p>
<p>From the client's perspective, it's reasonably straightforward. If you bind to
the <code>wl_seat</code> global, you get access to the following interface:</p>
<pre><code class="language-xml">&lt;interface name=&quot;wl_seat&quot; version=&quot;7&quot;&gt;
  &lt;enum name=&quot;capability&quot; bitfield=&quot;true&quot;&gt;
    &lt;entry name=&quot;pointer&quot; value=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;entry name=&quot;keyboard&quot; value=&quot;2&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;entry name=&quot;touch&quot; value=&quot;4&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/enum&gt;

  &lt;event name=&quot;capabilities&quot;&gt;
    &lt;arg name=&quot;capabilities&quot; type=&quot;uint&quot; enum=&quot;capability&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/event&gt;

  &lt;event name=&quot;name&quot; since=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
    &lt;arg name=&quot;name&quot; type=&quot;string&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/event&gt;

  &lt;request name=&quot;get_pointer&quot;&gt;
    &lt;arg name=&quot;id&quot; type=&quot;new_id&quot; interface=&quot;wl_pointer&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/request&gt;

  &lt;request name=&quot;get_keyboard&quot;&gt;
    &lt;arg name=&quot;id&quot; type=&quot;new_id&quot; interface=&quot;wl_keyboard&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/request&gt;

  &lt;request name=&quot;get_touch&quot;&gt;
    &lt;arg name=&quot;id&quot; type=&quot;new_id&quot; interface=&quot;wl_touch&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/request&gt;

  &lt;request name=&quot;release&quot; type=&quot;destructor&quot; since=&quot;5&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/interface&gt;
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: This interface has been updated many times - take note of the version
when you bind to the global. This book assumes you're binding to the latest
version, which is version 7 at the time of writing.</p>
<p>This interface is relatively straightforward. The server will send the client a
<code>capabilities</code> event to signal what kinds of input devices are supported by this
seat — represented by a bitfield of <code>capability</code> values — and the
client can bind to the input devices it wishes to use accordingly. For example,
if the server sends <code>capabilities</code> where<br />
<code>(caps &amp; WL_SEAT_CAPABILITY_KEYBOARD) &gt; 0</code> is true, the client may then use the
<code>get_keyboard</code> request to obtain a <code>wl_keyboard</code> object for this seat. The
semantics for each particular input device are covered in the remaining
chapters.</p>
<p>Before we get to those, let's cover some common semantics.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#event-serials" id="event-serials">Event serials</a></h2>
<p>Some actions that a Wayland client may perform require a trivial form of
authentication in the form of input event serials. For example, a client which
opens a popup (a context menu summoned with a rick click is one kind of popup)
may want to &quot;grab&quot; all input events server-side from the affected seat until the
popup is dismissed.  To prevent abuse of this feature, the server can assign
serials to each input event it sends, and require the client to include one of
these serials in the request.</p>
<p>When the server receives such a request, it looks up the input event associated
with the given serial and makes a judgement call. If the event was too long ago,
or for the wrong surface, or wasn't the right kind of event — for example,
it could reject grabs when you wiggle the mouse, but allow them when you click
— it can reject the request.</p>
<p>From the server's perspective, they can simply send a incrementing integer with
each input event, and record the serials which are considered valid for a
particular use-case for later validation. The client receives these serials from
their input event handlers, and can simply pass them back right away to perform
the desired action.</p>
<p>We'll discuss these in more detail in later chapters, when we start covering
the specific requests which require input event serials to validate them.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#input-frames" id="input-frames">Input frames</a></h2>
<p>A single input event from an input device may be broken up into several Wayland
events for practical reasons. For example, a <code>wl_pointer</code> will emit an <code>axis</code>
event as you use the scroll wheel, but it will separately emit an event telling
you what <em>kind</em> of axis it was: scroll wheel, a finger on a touchpad, tilting
the scroll wheel to the side, etc. The same input event from the input source
may have also included some motion of the mouse, or the click of a button, if
the user did all of these things quickly enough.</p>
<p>The semantic grouping of these related events differs slightly from input type
to input type, but the <code>frame</code> event is generally common between them. In short,
if you buffer up all of the input events you receive from a device, then wait
for the <code>frame</code> event to signal that you've received all events for a single
input &quot;frame&quot;, you can interpret the buffered up <em>Wayland</em> events as a single
<em>input</em> event, then reset the buffer and start collecting events for the next
frame.</p>
<p>If this sounds too complicated, don't sweat it. Many applications don't have to
worry about input frames. It's only when you start doing more complex input
event handling that you'll want to concern yourself with this.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#releasing-devices" id="releasing-devices">Releasing devices</a></h2>
<p>When you're done using a device, each interface has a <code>release</code> event you can
use to clean it up. It'll look something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-xml">&lt;request name=&quot;release&quot; type=&quot;destructor&quot; /&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Easy enough.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#pointer-input" id="pointer-input">Pointer input</a></h1>
<p>Using the <code>wl_seat.get_pointer</code> request, clients may obtain a <code>wl_pointer</code>
object. The server will send events to it whenever the user moves their pointer,
presses mouse buttons, uses the scroll wheel, etc — whenever the pointer
is over one of your surfaces. We can determine if this condition is met with the
<code>wl_pointer.enter</code> event:</p>
<pre><code class="language-xml">&lt;event name=&quot;enter&quot;&gt;
  &lt;arg name=&quot;serial&quot; type=&quot;uint&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;arg name=&quot;surface&quot; type=&quot;object&quot; interface=&quot;wl_surface&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;arg name=&quot;surface_x&quot; type=&quot;fixed&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;arg name=&quot;surface_y&quot; type=&quot;fixed&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/event&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The server sends this event when the pointer moves over one of our surfaces, and
specifies both the surface that was &quot;entered&quot;, as well as the surface-local
coordinates (from the top-left corner) that the pointer is positioned over.
Coordinates here are specified with the &quot;fixed&quot; type, which you may remember
from chapter 2.1 represents a 24.8-bit fixed-precision number
(<code>wl_fixed_to_double</code> will convert this to C's <code>double</code> type).</p>
<p>When the pointer is moved away from your surface, the corresponding event is
more brief:</p>
<pre><code class="language-xml">&lt;event name=&quot;leave&quot;&gt;
  &lt;arg name=&quot;serial&quot; type=&quot;uint&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;arg name=&quot;surface&quot; type=&quot;object&quot; interface=&quot;wl_surface&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/event&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Once a pointer has entered your surface, you'll start receiving additional
events for it, which we'll discuss shortly. The first thing you will likely want
to do, however, is provide a cursor image. The process is as such:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a new <code>wl_surface</code> with the <code>wl_compositor</code>.</li>
<li>Use <code>wl_pointer.set_cursor</code> to attach that surface to the pointer.</li>
<li>Attach a cursor image <code>wl_buffer</code> to the surface and commit it.</li>
</ol>
<p>The only new API introduced here is <code>wl_pointer.set_cursor</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-xml">&lt;request name=&quot;set_cursor&quot;&gt;
  &lt;arg name=&quot;serial&quot; type=&quot;uint&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;arg name=&quot;surface&quot; type=&quot;object&quot; interface=&quot;wl_surface&quot; allow-null=&quot;true&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;arg name=&quot;hotspot_x&quot; type=&quot;int&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;arg name=&quot;hotspot_y&quot; type=&quot;int&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/request&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>serial</code> here has to come from the <code>enter</code> event. The <code>hotspot_x</code> and
<code>hotspot_y</code> arguments specify the cursor-surface-local coordinates of the
&quot;hotspot&quot;, or the effective position of the pointer within the cursor image
(e.g. at the tip of an arrow). Note also that the surface can be null —
use this to hide the cursor entirely.</p>
<p>If you're looking for a good source of cursor images, libwayland ships with a
separate <code>wayland-cursor</code> library, which can load X cursor themes from disk and
create <code>wl_buffers</code> for them. See <code>wayland-cursor.h</code> for details, or the updates
to our example client in chapter 9.5.</p>
<small>
  <em>
    Note: wayland-cursor includes code for dealing with animated cursors, which
    weren't even cool in 1998. If I were you, I wouldn't bother with that.  No
    one has ever complained that my Wayland clients don't support animated
    cursors.
  </em>
</small>
<p>After the cursor has entered your surface and you have attached an appropriate
cursor, you're ready to start processing input events. There are motion, button,
and axis events.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#pointer-frames" id="pointer-frames">Pointer frames</a></h2>
<p>A single frame of input processing on the server could carry information about
lots of changes — for example, polling the mouse once could return, in a
single packet, an updated position and the release of a button. The server sends
these changes as separate <em>Wayland</em> events, and uses the &quot;frame&quot; event to group
them together.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;event name=&quot;frame&quot;&gt;&lt;/event&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Clients should accumulate all <code>wl_pointer</code> events as they're received, then
process pending inputs as a single pointer event once the &quot;frame&quot; event is
received.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#motion-events" id="motion-events">Motion events</a></h2>
<p>Motion events are specified in the same coordinate space as the <code>enter</code> event
uses, and are straightforward enough:</p>
<pre><code class="language-xml">&lt;event name=&quot;motion&quot;&gt;
  &lt;arg name=&quot;time&quot; type=&quot;uint&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;arg name=&quot;surface_x&quot; type=&quot;fixed&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;arg name=&quot;surface_y&quot; type=&quot;fixed&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/event&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Like all input events which include a timestamp, the <code>time</code> value is a
monotonically increasing millisecond-precision timestamp associated with this
input event.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#button-events" id="button-events">Button events</a></h2>
<p>Button events are mostly self-explanatory:</p>
<pre><code class="language-xml">&lt;enum name=&quot;button_state&quot;&gt;
  &lt;entry name=&quot;released&quot; value=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;entry name=&quot;pressed&quot; value=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/enum&gt;

&lt;event name=&quot;button&quot;&gt;
  &lt;arg name=&quot;serial&quot; type=&quot;uint&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;arg name=&quot;time&quot; type=&quot;uint&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;arg name=&quot;button&quot; type=&quot;uint&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;arg name=&quot;state&quot; type=&quot;uint&quot; enum=&quot;button_state&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/event&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>However, the <code>button</code> argument merits some additional explanation. This number
is a platform-specific input event, though note that FreeBSD reuses the Linux
values. You can find these values for Linux in <code>linux/input-event-codes.h</code>, and
the most useful ones will probably be represented by the constants <code>BTN_LEFT</code>,
<code>BTN_RIGHT</code>, and <code>BTN_MIDDLE</code>. There are more, I'll leave you to peruse the
header at your leisure.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#axis-events" id="axis-events">Axis events</a></h2>
<p>The axis event is used for scrolling actions, such as rotating your scroll wheel
or rocking it from left to right. The most basic form looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-xml">&lt;enum name=&quot;axis&quot;&gt;
  &lt;entry name=&quot;vertical_scroll&quot; value=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;entry name=&quot;horizontal_scroll&quot; value=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/enum&gt;

&lt;event name=&quot;axis&quot;&gt;
  &lt;arg name=&quot;time&quot; type=&quot;uint&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;arg name=&quot;axis&quot; type=&quot;uint&quot; enum=&quot;axis&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;arg name=&quot;value&quot; type=&quot;fixed&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/event&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>However, axis events are complex, and this is the part of the <code>wl_pointer</code>
interface which has received the most attention over the years. Several
additional events exist which increase the specificity of the axis event:</p>
<pre><code class="language-xml">&lt;enum name=&quot;axis_source&quot;&gt;
  &lt;entry name=&quot;wheel&quot; value=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;entry name=&quot;finger&quot; value=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;entry name=&quot;continuous&quot; value=&quot;2&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;entry name=&quot;wheel_tilt&quot; value=&quot;3&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/enum&gt;

&lt;event name=&quot;axis_source&quot; since=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
  &lt;arg name=&quot;axis_source&quot; type=&quot;uint&quot; enum=&quot;axis_source&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/event&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The axis_source event tells you what kind of axis was actuated - a scroll wheel,
or a finger on a touchpad, tilting a rocker to the side, or something more
novel. This event is simple, but the remainder are less so:</p>
<pre><code class="language-xml">&lt;event name=&quot;axis_stop&quot; since=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
  &lt;arg name=&quot;time&quot; type=&quot;uint&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;arg name=&quot;axis&quot; type=&quot;uint&quot; enum=&quot;axis&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/event&gt;

&lt;event name=&quot;axis_discrete&quot; since=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
  &lt;arg name=&quot;axis&quot; type=&quot;uint&quot; enum=&quot;axis&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;arg name=&quot;discrete&quot; type=&quot;int&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/event&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The precise semantics of these two events are complex, and if you wish to
leverage them I recommend a careful reading of the summaries in <code>wayland.xml</code>.
In short, the <code>axis_discrete</code> event is used to disambiguate axis events on an
arbitrary scale from discrete steps of, for example, a scroll wheel where each
&quot;click&quot; of the wheel represents a single discrete change in the axis value.  The
<code>axis_stop</code> event signals that a discrete user motion has completed, and is used
when accounting for a scrolling event which takes place over several frames. Any
future events should be interpreted as a separate motion.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#xkb-briefly" id="xkb-briefly">XKB, briefly</a></h1>
<p>The next input device on our list is keyboards, but we need to stop and give you
some additional context before we discuss them. Keymaps are an essential detail
involved in keyboard input, and XKB is the recommended way of handling them on
Wayland.</p>
<p>When you press a key on your keyboard, it sends a <em>scancode</em> to the computer,
which is simply a number assigned to that physical key. On my keyboard, scancode
1 is the Escape key, the '1' key is scancode 2, 'a' is 30, Shift is 42, and so
on.  I use a US ANSI keyboard layout, but there are many other layouts, and
their scancodes differ. On my friend's German keyboard, scancode 12 produces
'ß', while mine produces '-'.</p>
<p>To solve this problem, we use a library called &quot;xkbcommon&quot;, which is named for
its role as the common code from XKB (X KeyBoard) extracted into a standalone
library. XKB defines a huge number of key <em>symbols</em>, such as XKB_KEY_A, and
XKB_KEY_ssharp (ß, from German), and XKB_KEY_kana_WO (を, from Japanese).</p>
<p>Identifying these keys and correlating them with key symbols like this is only
part of the problem, however. 'a' can produce 'A' if the shift key is held down,
'を' is written as 'ヲ' in Katakana mode, and while there is strictly speaking
an uppercase version of 'ß', it's hardly ever used and certainly never typed.
Keys like Shift are called <em>modifiers</em>, and groups like Hiragana and Katakana
are called <em>groups</em>. Some modifiers can <em>latch</em>, like Caps Lock. XKB has
primitives for dealing with all of these cases, and maintains a state machine
which tracks what your keyboard is doing and figures out exactly which <em>Unicode
codepoints</em> the user is trying to type.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#using-xkb" id="using-xkb">Using XKB</a></h2>
<p>So how is xkbcommon actually used? Well, the first step is to link to it and
grab the header, <code>xkbcommon/xkbcommon.h</code>.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup> Most programs which utilize
xkbcommon will have to manage three objects:</p>
<ul>
<li>xkb_context: a handle used for configuring other XKB resources</li>
<li>xkb_keymap: a mapping from scancodes to key symbls</li>
<li>xkb_state: a state machine that turns key symbols into UTF-8 strings</li>
</ul>
<p>The process for setting this up usually goes as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use <code>xkb_context_new</code> to create a new xkb_context, passing it
<code>XKB_CONTEXT_NO_FLAGS</code> unless you're doing something weird.</li>
<li>Obtain a key map as a string.*</li>
<li>Use <code>xkb_keymap_new_from_string</code> to create an <code>xkb_keymap</code> for this key map.
There's only one key map format, <code>XKB_KEYMAP_FORMAT_TEXT_V1</code>, which you'll
pass for the format parameter. Again, unless you're doing something weird,
you'll use <code>XKB_KEYMAP_COMPILE_NO_FLAGS</code> for the flags.</li>
<li>Use <code>xkb_state_new</code> to create an xkb_state with your keymap. The state will
increment the refcount for the keymap, so use <code>xkb_keymap_unref</code> if you're
done with it yourself.</li>
<li>Obtain scancodes from a keyboard.*</li>
<li>Feed the scancodes into <code>xkb_state_key_get_one_sym</code> to get keysyms, and into
<code>xkb_state_key_get_utf8</code> to get UTF-8 strings. Tada!</li>
</ol>
<div style="text-align: right">
  <em>* These steps are discussed in the next section.</em>
</div>
<p>In terms of code, the process looks like the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">#include &lt;xkbcommon/xkbcommon.h&gt; // -lxkbcommon
/* ... */

const char *keymap_str = /* ... */;

/* Create an XKB context */
struct xkb_context *context = xkb_context_new(XKB_CONTEXT_NO_FLAGS);

/* Use it to parse a keymap string */
struct xkb_keymap *keymap = xkb_keymap_new_from_string(
    xkb_context, keymap_str, XKB_KEYMAP_FORMAT_TEXT_V1,
    XKB_KEYMAP_COMPILE_NO_FLAGS);

/* Create an XKB state machine */
struct xkb_state *state = xkb_state_new(keymap);
</code></pre>
<p>Then, to process scancodes:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">int scancode = /* ... */;

xkb_keysym_t sym = xkb_state_key_get_one_sym(xkb_state, scancode);
if (sym == XKB_KEY_F1) {
    /* Do the thing you do when the user presses F1 */
}

char buf[128];
xkb_state_key_get_utf8(xkb_state, scancode, buf, sizeof(buf));
printf(&quot;UTF-8 input: %s\n&quot;, buf);
</code></pre>
<p>Equipped with these details, we're ready to tackle processing keyboard input.</p>
<div class="footnote-definition" id="1"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">1</sup>
<p>xkbcommon ships with a pc file: use <code>pkgconf --cflags xkbcommon</code> and <code>pkgconf --libs xkbcommon</code>, or your build system's preferred way of consuming pc files.</p>
</div>
<h1><a class="header" href="#keyboard-input" id="keyboard-input">Keyboard input</a></h1>
<p>Equipped with an understanding of how to use XKB, let's extend our Wayland code
to provide us with key events to feed into it. Similarly to how we obtained a
<code>wl_pointer</code> resource, we can use the <code>wl_seat.get_keyboard</code> request to create a
<code>wl_keyboard</code> for a seat whose capabilities include
<code>WL_SEAT_CAPABILITY_KEYBOARD</code>. When you're done with it, you should send the
&quot;release&quot; request:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;request name=&quot;release&quot; type=&quot;destructor&quot; since=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
&lt;/request&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>This will allow the server to clean up the resources associated with this
keyboard.</p>
<p>But how do you actually use it? Let's start with the basics.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#key-maps" id="key-maps">Key maps</a></h2>
<p>When you bind to <code>wl_keyboard</code>, the first event that the server is likely to
send is <code>keymap</code>.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;enum name=&quot;keymap_format&quot;&gt;
  &lt;entry name=&quot;no_keymap&quot; value=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;entry name=&quot;xkb_v1&quot; value=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/enum&gt;

&lt;event name=&quot;keymap&quot;&gt;
  &lt;arg name=&quot;format&quot; type=&quot;uint&quot; enum=&quot;keymap_format&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;arg name=&quot;fd&quot; type=&quot;fd&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;arg name=&quot;size&quot; type=&quot;uint&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/event&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>keymap_format</code> enum is provided in the event that we come
up with a new format for keymaps, but at the time of writing, XKB keymaps are
the only format which the server is likely to send.</p>
<p>Bulk data like this is transferred over file descriptors. We could simply read
from the file descriptor, but in general it's recommended to mmap it instead.
In C, this could look similar to the following code:</p>
<pre><code>#include &lt;sys/mman.h&gt;
// ...

static void wl_keyboard_keymap(void *data, struct wl_keyboard *wl_keyboard,
        uint32_t format, int32_t fd, uint32_t size) {
    assert(format == WL_KEYBOARD_KEYMAP_FORMAT_XKB_V1);
    struct my_state *state = (struct my_state *)data;

    char *map_shm = mmap(NULL, size, PROT_READ, MAP_PRIVATE, fd, 0);
    assert(map_shm != MAP_FAILED);

    struct xkb_keymap *keymap = xkb_keymap_new_from_string(
        state-&gt;xkb_context, map_shm, XKB_KEYMAP_FORMAT_TEXT_V1,
        XKB_KEYMAP_COMPILE_NO_FLAGS);
    munmap(map_shm, size);
    close(fd);

    // ...do something with keymap...
}
</code></pre>
<p>Once we have a keymap, we can interpret future keypress events for this
<code>wl_keyboard</code>. Note that the server can send a new keymap at any time, and all
future key events should be interpreted in that light.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#keyboard-focus" id="keyboard-focus">Keyboard focus</a></h2>
<pre><code>&lt;event name=&quot;enter&quot;&gt;
  &lt;arg name=&quot;serial&quot; type=&quot;uint&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;arg name=&quot;surface&quot; type=&quot;object&quot; interface=&quot;wl_surface&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;arg name=&quot;keys&quot; type=&quot;array&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/event&gt;

&lt;event name=&quot;leave&quot;&gt;
  &lt;arg name=&quot;serial&quot; type=&quot;uint&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;arg name=&quot;surface&quot; type=&quot;object&quot; interface=&quot;wl_surface&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/event&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Like <code>wl_pointer</code>'s &quot;enter&quot; and &quot;leave&quot; events are issued when a pointer is
moved over your surface, the server sends <code>wl_keyboard.enter</code> when a surface
receives keyboard focus, and <code>wl_keyboard.leave</code> when it's lost. Many
applications will change their appearance under these conditions — for
example, to start drawing a blinking caret.</p>
<p>The &quot;enter&quot; event also includes an array of currently pressed keys. This is an
array of 32-bit unsigned integers, each representing the scancode of a pressed
key.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#input-events" id="input-events">Input events</a></h2>
<p>Once the keyboard has entered your surface, you can expect to start receiving
input events.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;enum name=&quot;key_state&quot;&gt;
  &lt;entry name=&quot;released&quot; value=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;entry name=&quot;pressed&quot; value=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/enum&gt;

&lt;event name=&quot;key&quot;&gt;
  &lt;arg name=&quot;serial&quot; type=&quot;uint&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;arg name=&quot;time&quot; type=&quot;uint&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;arg name=&quot;key&quot; type=&quot;uint&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;arg name=&quot;state&quot; type=&quot;uint&quot; enum=&quot;key_state&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/event&gt;

&lt;event name=&quot;modifiers&quot;&gt;
  &lt;arg name=&quot;serial&quot; type=&quot;uint&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;arg name=&quot;mods_depressed&quot; type=&quot;uint&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;arg name=&quot;mods_latched&quot; type=&quot;uint&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;arg name=&quot;mods_locked&quot; type=&quot;uint&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;arg name=&quot;group&quot; type=&quot;uint&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/event&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The &quot;key&quot; event is sent when the user presses or releases a key. Like many input
events, a serial is included which you can use to associate future requests with
this input event. The &quot;key&quot; is the scancode of the key which was pressed or
released, and the &quot;state&quot; is the pressed or released state of that key.</p>
<p><strong>Important</strong>: the scancode from this event is the Linux evdev scancode. To
translate this to an XKB scancode, you must add 8 to the evdev scancode.</p>
<p>The modifiers event includes a similar serial, as well as masks of the
depressed, latched, and locked modifiers, and the index of the input group
currently in use. A modifier is depressed, for example, while you hold down
Shift. A modifier can latch, such as pressing Shift with sticky keys enabled -
it'll stop taking effect after the next non-modifier key is pressed. And a
modifier can be locked, such as when caps lock is toggled on or off. Input
groups are used to switch between various keyboard layouts, such as toggling
between ISO and ANSI layouts, or for more language-specific features.</p>
<p>The interpretation of modifiers is keymap-specific. You should forward them both
to XKB to deal with. Most implementations of the &quot;modifiers&quot; event are
straightforward:</p>
<pre><code>static void wl_keyboard_modifiers(void *data, struct wl_keyboard *wl_keyboard,
        uint32_t serial, uint32_t depressed, uint32_t latched,
        uint32_t locked, uint32_t group) {
    struct my_state *state = (struct my_state *)data;
    xkb_state_update_mask(state-&gt;xkb_state,
        depressed, latched, locked, 0, 0, group);
}
</code></pre>
<h2><a class="header" href="#key-repeat" id="key-repeat">Key repeat</a></h2>
<p>The last event to consider is the &quot;repeat_info&quot; event:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;event name=&quot;repeat_info&quot; since=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
  &lt;arg name=&quot;rate&quot; type=&quot;int&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;arg name=&quot;delay&quot; type=&quot;int&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/event&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>In Wayland, the client is responsible for implementing &quot;key repeat&quot; — the
feature which continues to type characters as long as you've got the key held
doooooown. This request is sent to inform the client of the user's preferences
for key repeat settings. The &quot;delay&quot; is the number of milliseconds a key should
be held down for before key repeat kicks in, and the &quot;rate&quot; is the number of
characters per second to repeat until the key is released.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#touch-input" id="touch-input">Touch input</a></h1>
<p>On the surface, touchscreen input is fairly simple, and your implementation can
be simple as well. However, the protocol offers you a lot of depth, which
applications may take advantage of to provide more nuanced touch-driven gestures
and feedback.</p>
<p>Most touch-screen devices support <em>multitouch</em>: they can track multiple
locations where the screen has been touched. Each of these &quot;touch points&quot; is
assigned an ID which is unique among all currently active points where the
screen is being touched, but might be reused if you lift your finger and press
again.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Similarly to other input devices, you may obtain a <code>wl_touch</code> resource with
<code>wl_seat.get_touch</code>, and you should send a &quot;release&quot; request when you're
finished with it.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#touch-frames" id="touch-frames">Touch frames</a></h2>
<p>Like pointers, a single frame of touch processing on the server might carry
information about many changes, but the server sends these as discrete Wayland
events. The <code>wl_touch.frame</code> event is used to group these together.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;event name=&quot;frame&quot;&gt;&lt;/event&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Clients should accumulate all <code>wl_touch</code> events as they're received, then
process pending inputs as a single touch event when the &quot;frame&quot; event is
received.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#touch-and-release" id="touch-and-release">Touch and release</a></h2>
<p>The first events we'll look at are &quot;down&quot; and &quot;up&quot;, which are respectively
raised when you press your finger against the device, and remove your finger
from the device.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;event name=&quot;down&quot;&gt;
  &lt;arg name=&quot;serial&quot; type=&quot;uint&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;arg name=&quot;time&quot; type=&quot;uint&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;arg name=&quot;surface&quot; type=&quot;object&quot; interface=&quot;wl_surface&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;arg name=&quot;id&quot; type=&quot;int&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;arg name=&quot;x&quot; type=&quot;fixed&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;arg name=&quot;y&quot; type=&quot;fixed&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/event&gt;

&lt;event name=&quot;up&quot;&gt;
  &lt;arg name=&quot;serial&quot; type=&quot;uint&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;arg name=&quot;time&quot; type=&quot;uint&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;arg name=&quot;id&quot; type=&quot;int&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/event&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; coordinates are fixed-point coordinates in the coordinate space
of the surface which was touched - which is given in the &quot;surface&quot; argument.
The time is a monotonically increasing timestamp with an arbitrary epoch, in
milliseconds.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#2">2</a></sup> Note also the inclusion of a serial, which can be included in
future requests to associate them with this input event.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#motion" id="motion">Motion</a></h2>
<p>After you receive a &quot;down&quot; event with a specific touch ID, you will begin to
receive motion events which describe the movement of that touch point across the
device.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;event name=&quot;motion&quot;&gt;
  &lt;arg name=&quot;time&quot; type=&quot;uint&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;arg name=&quot;id&quot; type=&quot;int&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;arg name=&quot;x&quot; type=&quot;fixed&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;arg name=&quot;y&quot; type=&quot;fixed&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/event&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; coordinates here are in the relative coordinate space of the
surface which the &quot;enter&quot; event was sent for.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#gesture-cancellation" id="gesture-cancellation">Gesture cancellation</a></h2>
<p>Touch events often have to meet some threshold before they're recognized as a
gesture. For example, swiping across the screen from left to right could be used
by the Wayland compositor to switch between applications. However, it's not
until some threshold has been crossed — say, reaching the midpoint of the
screen in a certain amount of time — that the compositor recognizes this
behavior as a gesture.</p>
<p>Until this threshold is reached, the compositor will be sending normal touch
events for the surface that is being touched. Once the gesture is identified,
the compositor will send a &quot;cancel&quot; event to let you know that the compositor is
taking over.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;event name=&quot;cancel&quot;&gt;&lt;/event&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>When you receive this event, all active touch points are cancelled.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#shape-and-orientation" id="shape-and-orientation">Shape and orientation</a></h2>
<p>Some high-end touch hardware is capable of determining more information about
the way the user is interacting with it. For users of suitable hardware and
applications wishing to employ more advanced interactions or touch feedback, the
&quot;shape&quot; and &quot;orientation&quot; events are provided.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;event name=&quot;shape&quot; since=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
  &lt;arg name=&quot;id&quot; type=&quot;int&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;arg name=&quot;major&quot; type=&quot;fixed&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;arg name=&quot;minor&quot; type=&quot;fixed&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/event&gt;

&lt;event name=&quot;orientation&quot; since=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
  &lt;arg name=&quot;id&quot; type=&quot;int&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;arg name=&quot;orientation&quot; type=&quot;fixed&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/event&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The &quot;shape&quot; event defines an elliptical approximation of the shape of the object
which is touching the screen, with a major and minor axis represented in units
in the coordinate space of the touched surface. The orientation event rotates
this ellipse by specifying the angle between the major axis and the Y-axis of
the touched surface, in degrees.</p>
<hr />
<p>Touch is the last of the input devices supported by the Wayland protocol. With
this knowledge in hand, let's update our example code.</p>
<div class="footnote-definition" id="1"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">1</sup>
<p>Emphasis on &quot;might&quot; — don't make any assumptions based on the repeated use of a touch point ID.</p>
</div>
<div class="footnote-definition" id="2"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">2</sup>
<p>This means that separate timestamps can be compared to each other to obtain the time between events, but are not comparible to wall-clock time.</p>
</div>
<h1><a class="header" href="#expanding-our-example-code" id="expanding-our-example-code">Expanding our example code</a></h1>
<p>In previous chapters, we built a simple client which can present its surfaces on
the display. Let's expand this code a bit to build a client which can receive
input events. For the sake of simplicity, we're just going to be logging input
events to stderr.</p>
<p>This is going to require a lot more code than we've worked with so far, so get
strapped in. The first thing we need to do is set up the seat.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#setting-up-the-seat" id="setting-up-the-seat">Setting up the seat</a></h2>
<p>The first thing we'll need is a reference to a seat. We'll add it to our
<code>client_state</code> struct, and add keyboard, pointer, and touch objects for later
use as well:</p>
<pre><code class="language-diff">        struct wl_shm *wl_shm;
        struct wl_compositor *wl_compositor;

        float offset;
        uint32_t last_frame;
        int width, height;
</code></pre>
<p>We'll also need to update <code>registry_global</code> to register a listener for that
seat.</p>
<pre><code class="language-diff">                                wl_registry, name, &amp;xdg_wm_base_interface, 1);
                xdg_wm_base_add_listener(state-&gt;xdg_wm_base,
                                &amp;xdg_wm_base_listener, state);
+       } else if (strcmp(interface, wl_seat_interface.name) == 0) {

        }
 }
</code></pre>
<p>Note that we bind to the latest version of the seat interface, version 7. Let's
also rig up that listener:</p>
<pre><code class="language-diff">+static void
+wl_seat_capabilities(void *data, struct wl_seat *wl_seat, uint32_t capabilities)

+const static struct wl_seat_listener wl_seat_listener = {

+};
</code></pre>
<p>If you compile (<code>cc -o client client.c xdg-shell-protocol.c</code>) and run this now,
you should seat the name of the seat printed to stderr.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#rigging-up-pointer-events" id="rigging-up-pointer-events">Rigging up pointer events</a></h2>
<p>Let's get to pointer events. If you recall, pointer events from the Wayland
server are to be accumulated into a single logical event. For this reason, we'll
need to define a struct to store them in.</p>
<pre><code class="language-diff">+enum pointer_event_mask {
+       POINTER_EVENT_ENTER = 1 &lt;&lt; 0,

</code></pre>
<p>We'll be using a bitmask here to identify which events we've received for a
single pointer frame, and storing the relevant information from each event in
their respective fields. Let's add this to our state struct as well:</p>
<pre><code class="language-diff">        /* State */

object for seats which are capable of pointer input.</p>
<pre><code class="language-diff"> static void

<p>This merits some explanation. Recall that <code>capabilities</code> is a bitmask of the
kinds of devices supported by this seat - a bitwise AND (&amp;) with a capability
will produce a non-zero value if supported. Then, if we have a pointer and have
<em>not</em> already configured it, we take the first branch, using
<code>wl_seat_get_pointer</code> to obtain a pointer reference and storing it in our state.
If the seat does <em>not</em> support pointers, but we already have one configured, we
use <code>wl_pointer_release</code> to get rid of it. Remember that the capabilities of a
seat can change at runtime, for example when the user un-plugs and re-plugs
their mouse.</p>
<p>We also configured a listener for the pointer. Let's add the struct for that,
too:</p>
<pre><code class="language-diff">+const static struct wl_pointer_listener wl_pointer_listener = {
+       .enter = wl_pointer_enter,
+       .leave = wl_pointer_leave,
+       .motion = wl_pointer_motion,
+       .button = wl_pointer_button,
+       .axis = wl_pointer_axis,
+       .frame = wl_pointer_frame,
+       .axis_source = wl_pointer_axis_source,
+       .axis_stop = wl_pointer_axis_stop,
+       .axis_discrete = wl_pointer_axis_discrete,
+};
</code></pre>
<p>Pointers have a lot of events. Let's have a look at them.</p>
<pre><code class="language-diff">+static void
+wl_pointer_enter(void *data, struct wl_pointer *wl_pointer,
+               uint32_t serial, struct wl_surface *surface,
+               wl_fixed_t surface_x, wl_fixed_t surface_y)
+{
+       struct client_state *client_state = data;
+       client_state-&gt;pointer_event.event_mask |= POINTER_EVENT_ENTER;
+       client_state-&gt;pointer_event.serial = serial;
+       client_state-&gt;pointer_event.surface_x = surface_x,
+               client_state-&gt;pointer_event.surface_y = surface_y;

+wl_pointer_leave(void *data, struct wl_pointer *wl_pointer,

+{
+       struct client_state *client_state = data;
+       client_state-&gt;pointer_event.serial = serial;
+       client_state-&gt;pointer_event.event_mask |= POINTER_EVENT_LEAVE;
+}
</code></pre>
<p>The &quot;enter&quot; and &quot;leave&quot; events are fairly straightforward, and they set the
stage for the rest of the implementation. We update the event mask to include
the appropriate event, then populate it with the data we were provided. The
&quot;motion&quot; and &quot;button&quot; events are rather similar:</p>
<pre><code class="language-diff">+static void
+wl_pointer_motion(void *data, struct wl_pointer *wl_pointer, uint32_t time,
+               wl_fixed_t surface_x, wl_fixed_t surface_y)
+{
+       struct client_state *client_state = data;
+       client_state-&gt;pointer_event.event_mask |= POINTER_EVENT_MOTION;
+       client_state-&gt;pointer_event.time = time;
+       client_state-&gt;pointer_event.surface_x = surface_x,
+               client_state-&gt;pointer_event.surface_y = surface_y;
+}
+
+static void
+wl_pointer_button(void *data, struct wl_pointer *wl_pointer, uint32_t serial,
+               uint32_t time, uint32_t button, uint32_t state)
+{
+       struct client_state *client_state = data;
+       client_state-&gt;pointer_event.event_mask |= POINTER_EVENT_BUTTON;
+       client_state-&gt;pointer_event.time = time;
+       client_state-&gt;pointer_event.serial = serial;
+       client_state-&gt;pointer_event.button = button,
+               client_state-&gt;pointer_event.state = state;
+}
</code></pre>
<p>Axis events are somewhat more complex, because there are two axes: horizontal
and vertical. Thus, our <code>pointer_event</code> struct contains an array with two groups
of axis events. Our code to handle these ends up something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-diff">+static void

+       client_state-&gt;pointer_event.time = time;
+       client_state-&gt;pointer_event.axes[axis].valid = true;
+       client_state-&gt;pointer_event.axes[axis].value = value;
+}
+

+       client_state-&gt;pointer_event.event_mask |= POINTER_EVENT_AXIS_SOURCE;
+       client_state-&gt;pointer_event.axis_source = axis_source;
+}
+
+static void
+wl_pointer_axis_stop(void *data, struct wl_pointer *wl_pointer,
+               uint32_t time, uint32_t axis)
+{
+       struct client_state *client_state = data;
+       client_state-&gt;pointer_event.time = time;
+       client_state-&gt;pointer_event.event_mask |= POINTER_EVENT_AXIS_STOP;

</code></pre>
<p>Similarly straightforward, aside from the main change of updating whichever axis
was affected. Note the use of the &quot;valid&quot; boolean as well: it's possible that
we'll receive a pointer frame which updates one axis, but not another, so we use
this &quot;valid&quot; value to determine which axes were updated in the frame event.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, it's time for the main attraction: our &quot;frame&quot; handler.</p>
<pre><code class="language-diff">+static void

<p>It certainly is the longest of the bunch, isn't it? Hopefully it isn't too
confusing, though. All we're doing here is pretty-printing the accumulated state
for this frame to stderr. If you compile and run this again now, you should be
able to wiggle your mouse over the window and see input events printed out!</p>

<p>Now we can see why we added <code>assert.h</code> — we're using it here to make sure
that the keymap format is the one we expect. Then, we use mmap to map the file
descriptor the compositor sent us to a <code>char *</code> pointer we can pass into
<code>xkb_keymap_new_from_string</code>. Don't forget to munmap and close that fd
afterwards — then we set up our XKB state. Note as well that we have also
unrefed any previous XKB keymap or state that we had set up in a prior call to
this function, in case the compositor changes the keymap at runtime.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>When the keyboard &quot;enters&quot; our surrface, we have received keyboard focus. The
compositor forwards a list of keys which were already pressed at that time, and
here we just enumerate them and log their keysym names and UTF-8 equivalent.

<p>For modifiers, we could decode these further, but most applications won't need
to. We just update the XKB state here. As for handling key repeat — this
has a lot of constraints particular to your application. Do you want to repeat
text input? Do you want to repeat keyboard shortcuts? How does the timing of
these interact with your event loop? The answers to these questions is left for
you to decide.</p>
<p>If you compile this again, you should be able to start typing into the window
and see your input printed into the log. Huzzah!</p>

<p>Finally, we'll add support for touch-capable devices. Like pointers, a &quot;frame&quot;
event exists for touch devices. However, they're further complicated by the
possibility that mulitple touch points may be updated within a single frame.
We'll add some more structures and enums to represent the accumulated state:</p>

<p>Note that I've arbitrarily choosen 10 touchpoints here, with the assumption that
most users will only ever use that many fingers. For larger, multi-user touch
screens, you may need a higher limit. Additionally, some touch hardware supports
fewer than 10 touch points concurrently — 8 is also common, and hardware
which supports fewer still is common among older devices.</p>
<p>We'll add this struct to <code>client_state</code>:</p>

<p>We've repeated again the pattern of handling both the appearance and
disappearance of touch capabilities on the seat, so we're robust to devices
appearing and disappearing at runtime. It's less common for touch devices to be
hotplugged, though.</p>
<p>Here's the listener itself:</p>
<pre><code class="language-diff">+const static struct wl_touch_listener wl_touch_listener = {

</code></pre>
<p>To deal with multiple touch points, we'll need to write a small helper function:</p>
<pre><code class="language-diff">+static struct touch_point *
+get_touch_point(struct client_state *client_state, int32_t id)
+{
+       struct touch_event *touch = &amp;client_state-&gt;touch_event;
+       const size_t nmemb = sizeof(touch-&gt;points) / sizeof(struct touch_point);
+       int invalid = -1;
+       for (size_t i = 0; i &lt; nmemb; ++i) {
+               if (touch-&gt;points[i].id == id) {

+       touch-&gt;points[invalid].id = id;
+       return &amp;touch-&gt;points[invalid];
+}
</code></pre>
<p>The basic purpose of this function is to pick a <code>touch_point</code> from the array we
added to the <code>touch_event</code> struct, based on the touch ID we're receiving events
for. If we find an existing <code>touch_point</code> for that ID, we return it. If not, we
return the first available touch point. In case we run out, we return NULL.</p>
<p>Now we can take advantage of this to implement our first function: touch up.</p>
<pre><code class="language-diff">+static void
+wl_touch_down(void *data, struct wl_touch *wl_touch, uint32_t serial,
+               uint32_t time, struct wl_surface *surface, int32_t id,
+               wl_fixed_t x, wl_fixed_t y)
+{

+       struct touch_point *point = get_touch_point(client_state, id);
+       if (point == NULL) {
+               return;
+       }
+       point-&gt;event_mask |= TOUCH_EVENT_UP;
+       point-&gt;surface_x = wl_fixed_to_double(x),
+               point-&gt;surface_y = wl_fixed_to_double(y);
+       client_state-&gt;touch_event.time = time;
+       client_state-&gt;touch_event.serial = serial;
+}
</code></pre>
<p>Like the pointer events, we're also simply accumulating this state for later
use. We don't yet know if this event represents a complete touch frame. Let's
add something similar for touch up:</p>
<pre><code class="language-diff">+static void
+wl_touch_up(void *data, struct wl_touch *wl_touch, uint32_t serial,
+               uint32_t time, int32_t id)

+       struct touch_point *point = get_touch_point(client_state, id);
+       if (point == NULL) {
+               return;
+       }
+       point-&gt;event_mask |= TOUCH_EVENT_UP;
+}
</code></pre>
<p>And for motion:</p>
<pre><code class="language-diff">+static void
+wl_touch_motion(void *data, struct wl_touch *wl_touch, uint32_t time,
+               int32_t id, wl_fixed_t x, wl_fixed_t y)
+{
+       struct client_state *client_state = data;
+       struct touch_point *point = get_touch_point(client_state, id);
+       if (point == NULL) {
+               return;
+       }
+       point-&gt;event_mask |= TOUCH_EVENT_MOTION;
+       point-&gt;surface_x = x, point-&gt;surface_y = y;
+       client_state-&gt;touch_event.time = time;
+}
</code></pre>
<p>The touch cancel event is somewhat different, as it &quot;cancels&quot; all active touch
points at once. We'll just store this in the <code>touch_event</code>'s top-level event
mask.</p>
<pre><code class="language-diff">+static void
+wl_touch_cancel(void *data, struct wl_touch *wl_touch)
+{
+       struct client_state *client_state = data;
+       client_state-&gt;touch_event.event_mask |= TOUCH_EVENT_CANCEL;
+}
</code></pre>
<p>The shape and orientation events are similar to up, down, and move, however, in
that they inform us about the dimensions of a specific touch point.</p>
<pre><code class="language-diff">+static void
+wl_touch_shape(void *data, struct wl_touch *wl_touch,
+               int32_t id, wl_fixed_t major, wl_fixed_t minor)
+{
+       struct client_state *client_state = data;
+       struct touch_point *point = get_touch_point(client_state, id);
+       if (point == NULL) {
+               return;
+       }
+       point-&gt;event_mask |= TOUCH_EVENT_SHAPE;
+       point-&gt;major = major, point-&gt;minor = minor;
+}
+
+static void
+wl_touch_orientation(void *data, struct wl_touch *wl_touch,
+               int32_t id, wl_fixed_t orientation)
+{
+       struct client_state *client_state = data;
+       struct touch_point *point = get_touch_point(client_state, id);

+       }
+       point-&gt;event_mask |= TOUCH_EVENT_ORIENTATION;
+       point-&gt;orientation = orientation;
+}
</code></pre>
<p>And finally, upon receiving a frame event, we can interpret all of this
accumulated state as a single input event, much like our pointer code.</p>
<pre><code class="language-diff">+static void
+wl_touch_frame(void *data, struct wl_touch *wl_touch)

+               if (!point-&gt;valid) {
+                       continue;

</code></pre>
<p>Compile and run this again, and you'll be able to see touch events printed to
stderr as you interact with your touch device (assuming you have such a device
to test with). And now our client supports input!</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#whats-next" id="whats-next">What's next?</a></h2>
<p>There are a lot of different kinds of input devices, so extending our code to
support them was a fair bit of work — our code has grown by 2.5× in
this chapter alone. The rewards should feel pretty great, though, as you are now
familiar with enough Wayland concepts (and code) that you can implement a lot of
clients.</p>
<p>There's still a little bit more to learn — in the last few chapters, we'll
cover popup windows, context menus, interactive window moving and resizing,
clipboard and drag &amp; drop support, and, later, a handful of interesting protocol
extensions which support more niche use-cases. I definitely recommend reading at
least chapter 10.1 before you start building your own client, as it covers
things like having the window resized at the compositor's request.</p>
<div class="footnote-definition" id="1"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">1</sup>
<p>This actually does happen in practice!</p>
</div>
<h1><a class="header" href="#xdg-shell-in-depth" id="xdg-shell-in-depth">XDG shell in depth</a></h1>
<p>So far we've managed to display something on-screen in a top-level application
window, but there's more to XDG shell that we haven't fully appreciated yet.
Even the simplest application would be well-served to implement the
configuration lifecycle correctly, and xdg-shell offers useful features to more
complex application as well. The full breadth of xdg-shell's feature set
includes client/server negotiation on window size, multi-window hierarchies,
client-side decorations, and semantic positioning for windows like context
menus.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#configuration--lifecycle" id="configuration--lifecycle">Configuration &amp; lifecycle</a></h1>
<p>Previously, we created a window at a fixed size of our choosing: 640x480.
However, the compositor will often have an opinion about what size our window
should assume, and we may want to communicate our preferences as well. Failure
to do so will often lead to undesirable behavior, like parts of your window
being cut off by a compositor who's trying to tell you to make your surface
smaller.</p>
<p>The compositor can offer additional clues to the application about the context
in which it's being shown. It can let you know if your application is maximized
or fullscreen, tiled on one or more sides against other windows or the edge of
the display, focused or idle, and so on. As <code>wl_surface</code> is used to atomically
communicate surface changes from client to server, the <code>xdg_surface</code> interface
provides the following two messages for the compositor to suggest changes and
the client to acknowledge them:</p>
<pre><code class="language-xml">&lt;request name=&quot;ack_configure&quot;&gt;
  &lt;arg name=&quot;serial&quot; type=&quot;uint&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/request&gt;

&lt;event name=&quot;configure&quot;&gt;
  &lt;arg name=&quot;serial&quot; type=&quot;uint&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/event&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>On their own, these messages carry little meaning. However, each subclass of
<code>xdg_surface</code> (<code>xdg_toplevel</code> and <code>xdg_popup</code>) have additional events that the
server can send ahead of &quot;configure&quot;, to make each of the suggestions we've
mentioned so far. The server will send all of this state; maximized, focused,
a suggested size; then a <code>configure</code> event with a serial. When the client has
assumed a state consistent with these suggestions, it sends an <code>ack_configure</code>
request with the same serial to indicate this. Upon the next commit to the
associated <code>wl_surface</code>, the compositor will consider the state consistent.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#xdg-top-level-lifecycle" id="xdg-top-level-lifecycle">XDG top-level lifecycle</a></h2>
<p>Our example code from chapter 7 works, but it's not the best citizen of the
desktop right now. It does not assume the compositor's recommended size, and if
the user tries to close the window, it won't go away. Responding to these
compositor-supplied events implicates two Wayland events: <code>configure</code> and
<code>close</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-xml">&lt;event name=&quot;configure&quot;&gt;
  &lt;arg name=&quot;width&quot; type=&quot;int&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;arg name=&quot;height&quot; type=&quot;int&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;arg name=&quot;states&quot; type=&quot;array&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/event&gt;

&lt;event name=&quot;close&quot; /&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The width and height are the compositor's preferred size for the window<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup>, and
states is an array of the following values:</p>
<pre><code class="language-xml">&lt;enum name=&quot;state&quot;&gt;
  &lt;entry name=&quot;maximized&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;entry name=&quot;fullscreen&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;entry name=&quot;resizing&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;entry name=&quot;activated&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;entry name=&quot;tiled_left&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;entry name=&quot;tiled_right&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;entry name=&quot;tiled_top&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;entry name=&quot;tiled_bottom&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/enum&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The close event can be ignored, a typical reason being to show the user a
confirmation to save their unsaved work. Our example code from chapter 7 can be
updated fairly easily to support these events:</p>

  &lt;arg name=&quot;height&quot; type=&quot;int&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/request&gt;

&lt;request name=&quot;set_maximized&quot; /&gt;

&lt;request name=&quot;unset_maximized&quot; /&gt;

&lt;request name=&quot;set_fullscreen&quot; /&gt;

    interface=&quot;wl_output&quot;
    allow-null=&quot;true&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/request&gt;

&lt;request name=&quot;unset_fullscreen&quot; /&gt;

&lt;request name=&quot;set_minimized&quot; /&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The compositor indicates its acknowledgement of these requests by sending a
corresponding configure event.</p>
<div class="footnote-definition" id="1"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">1</sup>
<p>This takes into account the window geometry sent by the <code>set_window_geometry</code> request from the client. The suggested size only includes the space represented by the window geometry.</p>
</div>
<h1><a class="header" href="#popups" id="popups">Popups</a></h1>
<p>When designing software which utilizes application windows, there are many cases
where smaller secondary surfaces are used for various purposes. Some examples
include context menus which appear on right click, dropdown boxes to select a
value from several options, contextual hints which are shown when you hover the
mouse over a UI element, or menus and toolbars along the top and bottom of a
window. Often these will be nested, for example, by following a path like &quot;File
→ Recent Documents → Example.odt&quot;.</p>
<p>For Wayland, the XDG shell provides facilities for managing these windows:
popups. We looked at <code>xdg_surface</code>'s &quot;<code>get_toplevel</code>&quot; request for creating
top-level application windows earlier. In the case of popups, the &quot;<code>get_popup</code>&quot;
request is used instead.</p>
<pre><code class="language-xml">&lt;request name=&quot;get_popup&quot;&gt;
  &lt;arg name=&quot;id&quot; type=&quot;new_id&quot; interface=&quot;xdg_popup&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;arg name=&quot;parent&quot; type=&quot;object&quot; interface=&quot;xdg_surface&quot; allow-null=&quot;true&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;arg name=&quot;positioner&quot; type=&quot;object&quot; interface=&quot;xdg_positioner&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/request&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The first and second arguments are reasonably self-explanatory, but the third
one introduces a new concept: positioners. The purpose of the positioner is, as
the name might suggest, to <em>position</em> the new popup. This is used to allow the
compositor to participate in the positioning of popups using its priveleged
information, for example to avoid having the popup extend past the edge of the
display. We'll discuss positioners in chapter 10.4, for now you can simply create
one and pass it in without further configuration to achieve reasonably sane
default behavior, utilizing the appropriate <code>xdg_wm_base</code> request:</p>
<pre><code class="language-xml">&lt;request name=&quot;create_positioner&quot;&gt;
  &lt;arg name=&quot;id&quot; type=&quot;new_id&quot; interface=&quot;xdg_positioner&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/request&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>So, in short, we can:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a new <code>wl_surface</code></li>
<li>Obtain an <code>xdg_surface</code> for it</li>
<li>Create a new <code>xdg_positioner</code>, saving its configuration for chapter 10.4</li>
<li>Create an <code>xdg_popup</code> from our XDG surface and XDG positioner, assigning its
parent to the <code>xdg_toplevel</code> we created earlier.</li>
</ol>
<p>Then we can render and attach buffers to our popup surface with the same
lifecyle discussed earlier. We also have access to a few other popup-specific
features.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#configuration" id="configuration">Configuration</a></h2>
<p>Like the XDG toplevel configure event, the compositor has an event which it may
use to suggest the size for your popup to assume. Unlike toplevels, however,
this also includes a positioning event, which informs the client as to the
position of the popup relative to its parent surface.</p>
<pre><code class="language-xml">&lt;event name=&quot;configure&quot;&gt;
  &lt;arg name=&quot;x&quot; type=&quot;int&quot;
 summary=&quot;x position relative to parent surface window geometry&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;arg name=&quot;y&quot; type=&quot;int&quot;
 summary=&quot;y position relative to parent surface window geometry&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;arg name=&quot;width&quot; type=&quot;int&quot; summary=&quot;window geometry width&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;arg name=&quot;height&quot; type=&quot;int&quot; summary=&quot;window geometry height&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/event&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The client can influence these values with the XDG positioner, to be discussed
in chapter 10.4.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#popup-grabs" id="popup-grabs">Popup grabs</a></h2>
<p>Popup surfaces will often want to &quot;grab&quot; all input, for example to allow the
user to use the arrow keys to select different menu items. This is facilitiated
through the grab request:</p>
<pre><code class="language-xml">&lt;request name=&quot;grab&quot;&gt;
  &lt;arg name=&quot;seat&quot; type=&quot;object&quot; interface=&quot;wl_seat&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;arg name=&quot;serial&quot; type=&quot;uint&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/request&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>A prerequisite of this request is having received a qualifying input event, such
as a right click. The serial from this input event should be used in this
request. These semantics are covered in detail in chapter 9. The compositor can
cancel this grab later, for example if the user presses escape or clicks outside
of your popup.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#dismissal" id="dismissal">Dismissal</a></h2>
<p>In these cases where the compositor dismisses your popup, such as when the
escape key is pressed, the following event is sent:</p>
<pre><code class="language-xml">&lt;event name=&quot;popup_done&quot; /&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>To avoid race conditions, the compositor keeps the popup structures in memory
and services requests for them even after their dismissal. For more detail about
object lifetimes and race conditions, see chapter 2.4.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#destroying-popups" id="destroying-popups">Destroying popups</a></h2>
<p>Client-initiated destruction of a popup is fairly straightforward:</p>
<pre><code class="language-xml">&lt;request name=&quot;destroy&quot; type=&quot;destructor&quot; /&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>However, one detail bears mentioning: you must destroy all popups from the
top-down. The only popup you can destroy at any given moment is the top-most
one. If you don't, you'll be disconnected with a protocol error.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#interactive-move-and-resize" id="interactive-move-and-resize">Interactive move and resize</a></h1>
<p>Many application windows have interactive UI elements the user can use to drag
around or resize windows. Many Wayland clients, by default, expect to be
responsible for their own window decorations to provide these interactive
elements. On X11, application windows could position themselves independently
anywhere on the screen, and used this to facilitate these interactions.</p>
<p>However, a deliberate design trait of Wayland makes application windows ignorant
of their exact placement on screen or relative to other windows. This decision
affords Wayland compositors a greater deal of flexibility - windows could be
shown in several places at once, arranged in the 3D space of a VR scene, or
presented in any other novel way. Wayland is designed to be generic and widely
applicable to many devices and form factors.</p>
<p>To balance these two design needs, XDG toplevels offer two requests which can be
used to ask the compositor to begin an interactive move or resize operation. The
relevant parts of the interface are:</p>
<pre><code class="language-xml">&lt;request name=&quot;move&quot;&gt;
  &lt;arg name=&quot;seat&quot; type=&quot;object&quot; interface=&quot;wl_seat&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;arg name=&quot;serial&quot; type=&quot;uint&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/request&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Like the popup creation request explained in the previous chapter, you have to
provide an input event serial to start an interactive operation. For example,
when you receive a mouse button down event, you can use that event's serial to
begin an interactive move operation. The compositor will take over from here,
and begin an interactive operation to your window in its internal coordinate
space.</p>
<p>Resizing is a bit more complex, due to the need to specify which edges or
corners of the window are implicated in the operation:</p>
<pre><code class="language-xml">&lt;enum name=&quot;resize_edge&quot;&gt;
  &lt;entry name=&quot;none&quot; value=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;entry name=&quot;top&quot; value=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;entry name=&quot;bottom&quot; value=&quot;2&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;entry name=&quot;left&quot; value=&quot;4&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;entry name=&quot;top_left&quot; value=&quot;5&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;entry name=&quot;bottom_left&quot; value=&quot;6&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;entry name=&quot;right&quot; value=&quot;8&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;entry name=&quot;top_right&quot; value=&quot;9&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;entry name=&quot;bottom_right&quot; value=&quot;10&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/enum&gt;

&lt;request name=&quot;resize&quot;&gt;
  &lt;arg name=&quot;seat&quot; type=&quot;object&quot; interface=&quot;wl_seat&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;arg name=&quot;serial&quot; type=&quot;uint&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;arg name=&quot;edges&quot; type=&quot;uint&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/request&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>But otherwise, it functions much the same. If the user clicks and drags along
the bottom-left corner of your window, you may want to send an interactive
resize request with the corresponding seat &amp; serial, and set the edges argument
to bottom_left.</p>
<p>There's one additional request necessary for clients to totally implement
interactive client-side window decorations:</p>
<pre><code class="language-xml">&lt;request name=&quot;show_window_menu&quot;&gt;
  &lt;arg name=&quot;seat&quot; type=&quot;object&quot; interface=&quot;wl_seat&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;arg name=&quot;serial&quot; type=&quot;uint&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;arg name=&quot;x&quot; type=&quot;int&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;arg name=&quot;y&quot; type=&quot;int&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/request&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>A contextual menu offering window operations, such as closing or minimizing the
window, is often raised when clicking on window decorations. For clients where
window decorations are managed by the client, this serves to link the
client-driven interactions with compositor-driven meta operations like
minimizing windows. If your client uses client-side decorations, you may use
this request for this purpose.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#xdg-decoration" id="xdg-decoration">xdg-decoration</a></h2>
<p>The last detail which bears mentioning when discussing the behavior of
client-side decorations is the protocol which governs the negotiation of their
use in the first place. Different Wayland clients and servers may have different
preferences about the use of server-side or client-side window decorations. To
express these intentions, a protocol extension is used: <code>xdg-decoration</code>. It can
be found in wayland-protocols. The protocol provides a global:</p>
<pre><code class="language-xml">&lt;interface name=&quot;zxdg_decoration_manager_v1&quot; version=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
  &lt;request name=&quot;destroy&quot; type=&quot;destructor&quot; /&gt;

  &lt;request name=&quot;get_toplevel_decoration&quot;&gt;
    &lt;arg name=&quot;id&quot; type=&quot;new_id&quot; interface=&quot;zxdg_toplevel_decoration_v1&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;arg name=&quot;toplevel&quot; type=&quot;object&quot; interface=&quot;xdg_toplevel&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;/request&gt;
&lt;/interface&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>You may pass your xdg_toplevel object into the <code>get_toplevel_decoration</code> request
to obtain an object with the following interface:</p>
<pre><code class="language-xml">&lt;interface name=&quot;zxdg_toplevel_decoration_v1&quot; version=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
  &lt;request name=&quot;destroy&quot; type=&quot;destructor&quot; /&gt;

  &lt;enum name=&quot;mode&quot;&gt;
    &lt;entry name=&quot;client_side&quot; value=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;entry name=&quot;server_side&quot; value=&quot;2&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/enum&gt;

  &lt;request name=&quot;set_mode&quot;&gt;
    &lt;arg name=&quot;mode&quot; type=&quot;uint&quot; enum=&quot;mode&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/request&gt;

  &lt;request name=&quot;unset_mode&quot; /&gt;

  &lt;event name=&quot;configure&quot;&gt;
    &lt;arg name=&quot;mode&quot; type=&quot;uint&quot; enum=&quot;mode&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/event&gt;
&lt;/interface&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>set_mode</code> request is used to express a preference from the client, and
<code>unset_mode</code> is used to express no preference. The compositor will then use the
<code>configure</code> event to tell the client whether or not to use client-side
decorations. For more details, consult the full XML.</p>
