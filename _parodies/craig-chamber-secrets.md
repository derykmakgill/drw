## Chapter 2: Writing on the wall

“You!” Peter McCormack screamed towards at Craig as the Auror from the ministry led him away between two Dementors, frozen by an arm tie charm. “You did this!”

A gasp ran through the crowd of students that had gathered at scene. They had just noticed a large piece of parchment that had been tacked to the castle wall behind where McCormack had just been standing. 

They were so shocked they didn’t notice that McCormack had tried to break free and was now being dragged by the Dementors down the hall after being stunned by the Auror.

‘Enemies of the Ayre beware’ Craig read the legal document aloud smugly. ‘Welcome to law.’

A few students from Binance House began to step backwards from the crowd nervously. Several others from Core House took off running down the hall. Someone screamed.

Craig turned towards them. You’ll be next, shitcoiners.
