I've had several people message me conspiracies about me being a federal agent after my opposition to the Bitcoin Cash Infastruture Funding Plan. These wackos seem to believe that I, *all on my own,* defeated the IFP. That is not the case, and in fact, I very tentatively supported some version of it at first. I think developers should get paid! I just think they need a leash and collar, and I think ABC ultimately blundered their chance at selling the IFP to the industry. Surprisingly, this isn't the first time people in and out of Bitcoin have said I am a government operative. However, I am not in the CIA, FBI, DEA, US military or any other branch of government, and I never have been.
