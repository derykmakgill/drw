Someone said they're upset that more people knew about Paul Walker than Nelson Mandela. I'm actually happpy more people did! I don't want to live in a world where politicians are more important than entertainment. Shake off the chains! Go live your lives and let the politicans of all parties and ideaologies go to hell! And let's remember, there are places where they've outlawed your right to *not* care about political deaths. North Korea is one.
