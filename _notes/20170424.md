Devestating news. We lost my good friend Travis Mazer today. I'd just seen him in DC not long ago for dinner and we talked about his research in radical life extension. He was one of the most brilliant, funniest guys I've known, and we've all lost on what would have been a lifetime of achievement.

Dammit you bastard!!! RIP.
