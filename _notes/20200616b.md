I've been tentatively excited about [Hey.com](https://hey.com) since it was announced despite my concern that their servers are hosted in the US and thus in the gaze of our government's all-seeing eyes.
The latest demo only makes me more excited. They just *might* have done something both unique and valuable to email. It may even be unique and valuable enough to ignore the 
latest ridiculous Twitter and government-bureaucrat/lawyer mob the founders are organising against Apple. Apple doesn't want to list your app? Stiff. That doesn't give you the right to use illegitimate anti-trust legislation against them.
Maybe I'm answering my privacy concern right now. A company that is already verbally partnering up with daddy-government to enforce their bidding while they're still *invite-only* is 
probably *not* a company that will do their best to protect your data from illegal search and seizure.
