I just finished the “Bobiverse” sci-fi [audiobook](https://amzn.to/37h14Ia) series. I really can’t recommend it enough. Cryo, brain uploading, space exploration, terraforming, Van Neumann probes etc. Thanks [@cagrimmett](https://twitter.com/cagrimmett) for the recommendation! The fourth book is out in September.
