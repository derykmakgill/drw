I read the first three novelizations of the Halo games when I was *younger.* I loved them at the time but for whatever reason I didn't pick them up when the other books came out. I haven't actually played the games, or any other games, since Halo 3, but watching a recap of the story up to now got me interested again, and [*Halo: The Fall of Reach*](https://amzn.to/2N2MMSf) by Eric Nylund arrived today. Hoping I'll enjoy it enough to read all the latest books.
