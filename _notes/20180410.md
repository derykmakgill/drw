I wish more professors would package their lectures and writings into ebooks, audio series, videos, etc. Start Patreons, etc. All this ostensibly great material hidden behind cartelized academic publishers. They'd make more money and reach more students while still working in the traditional system and getting whatever benefits they see out of it.
