Supposed to be speaking in Warsaw Poland tomorrow afternoon but flight delays caused me to miss my connections. Poland is one of my favorite countries in the world and Tomek Ko≈Çodziejczuk is doing awesome work there with Weekend Kapitalizmu and spreading Objectivism in Polish. To my friends Izabela Ru and Agnieszka Rzewuska-Paca, I'll see you guys soon next time!
