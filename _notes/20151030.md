Take the tuition money, anywhere from 50k-200k, get yourself an apartment in Italy, two years of summer program at The Paideia Institute, and all the books you want. Travel around and see the classical ruins, email scholars, and write a blog. You'll get so much more out of it than studying Classics in college.
