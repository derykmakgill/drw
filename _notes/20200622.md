Maybe an unintended positive consequence of the Covid-19 panic and reaction will be the normalisation of exciting new grey economies. Restaurants and bars that don't want to comply with draconian distancing orders for example might go full speakeasy. Smuggling operations to work around rationing and price-fixing of "essential" goods could be mainstreamed. Maybe we'll see businesses operating "fronts" more often to stay open despite government orders to close. I say this is "exciting" only insofar as it creates a broader culture of *noncompliance* that leads to more practical freedom everywhere. That's my optimistic take. I don't think I want to write my pessimist's take...
