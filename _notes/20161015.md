Rereading one of my favorite books on Ancient Greece since I'm in Athens.
Edith Hamilton was so influential and had such a passion for the subject that she was made a citizen of Athens.
She had no doctorate degree because women weren't allowed to earn them at her university and her work was accomplished largely outside of academia. I remember my first classics professor in college laughing when I brought her up as the reason for wanting to study the subject. 
She wasn't part of the academic club so she deserved no consideration in his mind.
