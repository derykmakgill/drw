I'm signed up for [hey.com](https://hey.com) email. You can send me an email at mkgll@hey.com. I like some of the features. I really do. But when I think about using them at scale, they look like they'll break down. More on this later perhaps. And as I've said before, their [wacky crusade](https://derykmakgill.github.io/drw/notes/2020/06/16/20200616b/) to regulate Apple is more than offputting. I also think the design would drive me crazy. Maybe I'm old school but I like more [plain HTML,](https://derykmakgill.github.io/drw/notes/2020/06/24/20200624/) not trendy, trippy, colorful flat design that looks like, I don't know...a childrens television show? Maybe that's not the right comparison. But there's something childish about it.
