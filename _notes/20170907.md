I spent maybe an hour last night having drinks with the writer of Braveheart, Randall Wallace, at my hotel on the Big Island.
Total accident. I was at the bar and a little 4 year old boy walked up and sat down next to me. I gave him some fries that came with my burger and we started chatting. 

Maybe 10 minutes in his father sat down and when I asked him what he does, he said "I'm a writer."

We talked for a bit and I asked him what he's written. "Well I wrote Braveheart," he said.

Anyway some cool takeaways, besides the fact that he's very fun to talk to:

- He said his success came from the fact that he did the opposite of what Hollywood and the film institutes and universities said he should do and write.
- He was incredibly well read -- studied Latin, knows the Bible and classical literature and history. Said he wanted to write classic works like those, not stuff like the superhero movies today.
- He said he regularly sees William Wallace quoted on walls/monuments or at events and he laughs to himself and says "William Wallace didn't say that. I wrote that," but that he doesn't mind not getting credit. He wrote what "he would have wanted to hear if he were a soldier under William Wallace."
- He mentioned learning through apprenticeships and even brought up Isaac M. Morehouse's "if we taught bike riding like we teach careers" point, but with a different example.
