Ayn Rand on college and credentialism, from Atlas Shrugged:

>Wesley Mouch came from a family that had known neither poverty nor wealth nor distinction for many generations; it had clung, however, to a tradition of its own: that of being college-bred and, therefore, of despising men who were in business. The family's diplomas had always hung on the wall in a manner of reproach to the world because the diplomas had not automatically produced the material equivalents of their attested spiritual value.
â€¦In high school, Wesley Mouch had been one of the worst students and had passionately envied those who were the best. College taught him that he did not have to envy them at all.
