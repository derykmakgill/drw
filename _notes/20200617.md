I had expected that [Hey.com](https://hey.com) would allow customers to use their own domain, but apparently you're stuck with a "@hey.com" for the time-being at least. This is obviously less private and less secure. By making it trivial for anyone to know what email service you're using,  Hey opens users to a variety of attack surfaces. Better to allow custom domains. It's not a perfect solution, but neither are property fences, screen shields, or bike locks. The point is to make it a little bit harder and you immediately remove 90% of possible attackers.
