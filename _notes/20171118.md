College is one of the few products we pay a massive premium on, say is absolutely necessary, and yet actively hope we don't have to use.

Snow days, days where the professor gets stuck in traffic, or gets a little too sick to come in, and random scheduling errors are celebrated.

But if you signed up for a paid 3 week cooking seminar taught by a master chef, and a couple days out of those three weeks were simply canceled because of snow or sickness or whatever, would you be happy? Would you celebrate days class was canceled? 
Of course not. You'd feel cheated out of the product you valued and purchased.

Most students feel the opposite. I'd even bet if you canceled classes entirely for 4 years but told students they'd get the degree if they just paid tuition and hung around on campus, many would still stay. Not all, but enough to call the experience of mass university education into question.
A good learning environment, this does not make.
