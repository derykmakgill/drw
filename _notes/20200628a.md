Tip about buying books: you can often get perfect, first edition hardcovers of great books on eBay for cheaper than the mass-market paperback. I [read](https://derykmakgill.github.io/drw/replies/2020/06/23/20200623a/) *Ender's Game* recently and picked up a signed first edition copy of the parallel novel *Ender's Shadow* for $8.99.
