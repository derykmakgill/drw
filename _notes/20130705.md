I'm missing a train to Paris from Florence because none of the taxi drivers are enterprising enough to pick me up outside of an official pickup zone...but we'll figure out how to get there all the same, even if it means stowing away. Phil and I are visting the Schola Cantorum in two days to see Phillip Lasser perform.
