Goodbye Sarajevo. Short trip but I'm heading to Mississippi to guest lecture at The Institute for Humane Studies.

Thanks to Merima Bećirović and Admir Čavalić for putting together another amazing event. Bosnia is an interesting country. I came the first time last year expecting burned out tanks in the streets because of all the American fear propaganda. It's actually beautiful and fun and safe.
