I'm trying out Parler. My handle is [@mkgll.](https://parler.com/profile/mkgll/posts) I love attempts to make social media that is free from centralised information manipulation, but so many of them are just awful. The challenge for apps like Parler is to quickly grow out of many of its early adopters like those who just want a safe space to shit post political twaddle, Nazis, or other internet bums. GAB failed at this. Will Parler succeed?
