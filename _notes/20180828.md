I just won a contest for an ocean view room for two on a Royal Caribbean cruise next month! Bitcoin.com held a contest last to answer the question "how has cryptocurrency changed your life?"

What amazed me was how few people entered and how among those people that entered, most didn't follow the instructions to keep the video 30 seconds or less. Just putting your name in the hat and keeping your video short meant your odds were extremely high.
The cruise starts in Barcelona so I guess I need to find a flight....
