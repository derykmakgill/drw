Bitcoin will not succeed until people learn the lessons Mike Hearn tried to teach us! I tried to pass on the warning several times and was dismissed by people now in BCHN last year as a bad actor or paid operative. It might be too late, but I hope there's still time to avoid a split. As it is, I will not be holding Bitcoin Cash unless the effort to split is roundly defeated both practically and intellectually.
