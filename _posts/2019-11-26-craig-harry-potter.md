title: Craig Wright's 'Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone'
---

Professor Nick Snape stood at the front of the room, looking criminally. “There will be no foolish wand-waving or silly incantations in this class. As such, I don’t expect many of you to appreciate the subtle science and exact art that is potion-making. However, for those select few who possess, the predisposition…I can teach you how to bewitch the mind and ensnare the senses. I can tell you how to bottle fame, brew glory, and even put a stopper in death.”

Craig’s hand shot up.

“What is it, Wright?” Snape asked, irritated.

“I actually have a patent on the Death Stopper™.”

“What?”

“And the Bottle Fame™. Brewing Glory™ is pending but I wrote a paper on that way back in the 90s with a coffee stain and rusty staples to prove it when I was doing my third master’s program in chemical….”

“You impertinent boy!“ Snape interrupted, seething.

“What’s to stop me from suing you if you teach the students these formulas?” Craig asked?

“What…can you show me these patents?”

“I don’t need to prove anything to you here. That is what courts are for. I will demonstrate it to the Ministry of Magic, not here. But if you mix those potions now, I bankrupt you. ”

Snape considered Craig’s threat, then continued with the lesson and instructed the students to turn to page 45 of their textbook.

Craig’s hand shot up again. 

Snape ignored it. “Tell me students, what do you get when you cross wormwood with…”

“I recently registered the copyright to that essay. That book is plagiarizing me.”

The students and Snape watched aghast as the author’s name on the page slowly faded out and was replaced by “Craig Stephen Wright, Order of Merlin, First Class, Supreme Mugwump of the International Confederation of Wizards, Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot……” the titles ran off the page.

“And Wormwood is a Schedule 1 drug. In 2003 I did work for the Ministry of Magic Office of..”

“Will you shut up!” Snape screamed

“…Controlled Magical Substances and I will see you bent over by the Dementors in Azkaban before I let you turn my formulas into crime potions.’

Before a stunned Snape could respond, Craig stormed out of the room, followed by a couple of the best students and all of the worst, to start his own potions class.
