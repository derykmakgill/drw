title: Concerning the IFP
---

The [Bitcoin Cash Infastructurer Funding Plan](https://coinspice.io/news/bitcoin-abc-will-implement-bitcoin-cash-infrastructure-fund-of-5-during-may-15-2020-upgrade/) needs to be defeated. While there were one or two decent ideas in the original proposal, the shenanigans by ABC have proven that this is little more than a short-sighted cash grab that will turn Bitcoin Cash into an irrelevant altcoin (if it has not become that already through their actions in the SV split).

## What I like about the IFP

**Developers should get paid.** It makes no sense to boostrap what is attempting to be *the* world's global digital currency with a group of unpaid or donor funded hobbyists. 

**The fait accompli tone of the original proposal was refreshing in a generally timid industry obsessed with consulting every Reddit user for their opinion.** I suspect much of the current anti-IFP and anti-ABC rhetoric comes from outrage that Jiang Zhouer and ABC didn't ask permission first. But why should the miners ask permission? Bitcoin is not ruled by democratic vote, Twitter poll or Telegram consensus. Bitcoin is capitalist and decisions are thus made by miners who put up the capital investment to secure the network and validate transactions.
